How to watch, what to watch and whom to watch.
	
 
	
	10 for Today 	
		The 2018 Winter Olympic Games begin tonight in frigid PyeongChang with a combined South and North Korea team marching in the parade of nations at the Opening Ceremony. The local Olympic organizing committee is handing out blankets and hot-packs in hopes that the spectators will survive the cold. There are four new sports and six new nations at these Games, with several stars like Lindsey Vonn, Shaun White and Mikaela Shiffrin, hoping to add to their gold medal count. Though figure skating will command center stage, we will also be watching ski jumping, short track skating and bobsled, all sports that get attention but once every four years. The Winter Games are the fun games, a 17-day journey to meet new faces.

Dear Flipboard Community, |
	Flipboard 	
		Dear Flipboard Community, 	
		We are writing to let you know about a security incident we recently identified and addressed involving a subset of user data. We know transparency is important to our community, and we want to share with you what we have learned from our investigation, measures we have taken, as well as steps you can take. 	
		What happened 	
		We recently identified unauthorized access to some of our databases containing certain Flipboard users’ account information, including account credentials. In response to this discovery, we immediately launched an investigation and an external security firm was engaged to assist. Findings from the investigation indicate an unauthorized person accessed and potentially obtained copies of certain databases containing Flipboard user information between June 2, 2018 and March 23, 2019 and between April 21 - 22, 2019. 	
		What information was involved 	
		The databases involved may have contained your name, Flipboard username, cryptographically protected password and email address. 	
		Flipboard has always cryptographically protected passwords using a technique known by security experts as “salted hashing”. The benefit of hashing passwords is that we never need to store the passwords in plain text. Moreover, using a unique salt for each password in combination with the hashing algorithms makes it very difficult and requires significant computer resources to crack these hashed passwords. If you created or changed your password after March 14, 2012, it is hashed with a function called bcrypt. If you have not changed your password since then, it is uniquely salted and hashed with SHA-1. 	
		Additionally, if you connected your Flipboard account to a third-party account, including social media accounts, then the databases may have contained digital tokens used to connect your Flipboard account to that third-party account. We have not found any evidence the unauthorized person accessed third-party account(s) connected to your Flipboard accounts. As a precaution, we have replaced or deleted all digital tokens. 	
		Importantly, we do not collect from users, and this incident did not involve, Social Security numbers or other government-issued IDs, bank account, credit card, or other financial information. 	
		What we are doing 	
		As a precaution, we have reset all users’ passwords, even though the passwords were cryptographically protected and not all users’ account information was involved. You can continue to use Flipboard on devices from which you are already logged in. When you access your Flipboard account from a new device, or the next time you log into Flipboard after logging out of your account, you will be asked to create a new password. 	
		As another precautionary step, we disconnected tokens used to connect to all third-party accounts, and in collaboration with our partners, we replaced all digital tokens or deleted them where applicable. 	
		Additionally, to help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we implemented enhanced security measures and continue to look for additional ways to strengthen the security of our systems. We also notified law enforcement. 	
		What you can do 	
		You can continue to use Flipboard without further action. However, next time you log into your account, you will notice your Flipboard account password needs to be updated. You will find instructions on our support page (linked below) explaining how to create a new password. Also, if you use the same username and password you created for Flipboard for any other online service, we recommend you change your password there, too. 	
		If you connected your Flipboard account to a third-party account to see its content, you may notice in some cases that you need to reconnect it. On our support page you will also find instructions for how to do this. 	
		Where to find more information 	
		We deeply regret this incident happened. For more information and answers to frequently asked questions, we have created a support page with more details about the incident. 	
		Sincerely,
The Flipboard team

‘Get a grip’ - U-turns test backbenchers’ patience
Dissatisfaction sweeps through Conservative MPs
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

A U-turn is not always a bad thing, and polling suggests that most people are willing to forgive a government that changes its mind now and again - especially if the world is changing around it.

But with a summary of recent reversals now running to seven paragraphs, it’s little surprise that MPs and voters alike are getting restless.

‘get a grip’
Johnson’s U-turns test backbenchers’ patience
Back in December, with Boris Johnson commanding a majority of 80 after a landslide election victory, he found himself the toast of a grateful Conservative Party on the verge of delivering Brexit.

But eight months on, and with a string of high-profile U-turns behind him, the prime minister is coming under fire from his own side.

Tory MPs have accused Johnson of presiding over an “utter s***show” following another U-turn on face masks in schools, the Daily Mail says, warning that Downing Street needs to “get a grip”.

Instant Opinion: Quarantine is ‘phoney nonsense’
The Week’s daily round-up highlights the five best opinion pieces from across the British and international media, with excerpts from each.

1. Jenni Russell in The Times
“The logic of imposing quarantine is that the threat of spreading the virus on return is significant, justifying drastic restrictions on freedom, havoc for the struggling travel industry and huge costs for those who must isolate but cannot work from home... Yet the system for overseeing and enforcing quarantine is a shabby, incoherent mess, because nobody has designed it to be anything else.”

Could Italy leave the EU after coronavirus?
The post-pandemic relationship has come under strain
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Preoccupied as we are by Brexit, it’s easy to forget other European countries have their own quarrels with Brussels.

Italy’s may be the most substantive: many in the country feel they were abandoned by the EU when coronavirus struck. Whether their ill will bolsters the eurosceptic cause may depend on whether Brexit succeeds - so for now, all bets are off.

PANDEMIC FALLOUT
Could Italy leave the EU after coronavirus?
Italy has felt the full force of the coronavirus pandemic, with almost 290,000 cases and more than 35,000 deaths. And now, as the country tries return to some semblance of normality, a new threat to the status quo is emerging. 

Italians have been losing faith in the EU since their nation became the front line of the European migrant crisis in 2015, with Eurosceptic parties gaining significant ground in recent elections.

But the final straw for many voters may be the perceived failure by the EU to help Rome at the height of the health crisis, with some commentators claiming that Brussels’ response amounted to no less than an “abandonment” of Italy.

How Johnson headed off a Brexit rebellion
Downing Street has brokered a deal with Conservative MPs who balked at Boris Johnson’s plans to effectively break international law by overriding parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. 

The prime minister has agreed to amend the UK Internal Market Bill to allow MPs a vote before the government could activate powers in the legislation to override the EU divorce deal - a move that “could stave off a possible rebellion over the issue”, says the BBC.

How France is handling its coronavirus spike
The French government is facing calls to take urgent action to stem a spike in coronavirus cases that has triggered fears of so-called second wave of infections.

France’s Health Ministry reported a 10,593 new Covid cases on Thursday - the highest daily tally since the pandemic began - “prompting officials to urge people to limit social gatherings and maintain handwashing and other protective measures”, says Paris-based news agency AFP.

But despite the surge in outbreaks, President Emmanuel Macron and other leading politicians are reluctant to reimpose a national lockdown, saying that citizens must instead “learn to live with” with the virus.

“If we see similar pressures on the hospital sector this time around then it will be commonplace under the current guidance that people who are Covid-positive will be discharged back into care homes,” Professor Adam Gordon of the British Geriatrics Society told Channel 4 News.

White privilege theory ‘damaging working-class boys’
MPs told that concept leaves poorer white children with ‘status deficit’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The debate about white privilege has reached the Commons Education Select Committee, where a pair of academics said the concept could hold back the poorest white children.

The argument taps into complex connections between race, wealth and education. While many ethnic minorities children do appear to be poorly served by schools, white working-class boys are among the most disadvantaged.

Even that doesn’t tell the whole story. Every group is made up of many other small groups and individuals, some more privileged than others.

status deficit
White privilege theory ‘hurts working-class boys’
Pressure to apologise for “white privilege” is pushing white working-class boys even further “behind everyone else”, MPs have been warned.

Professor Matthew Goodwin, a politics professor at the University of Kent, told the Commons Education Select Committee yesterday that “over the last ten years our national conversation has become more consumed about other groups in society”.

White working-class boys, who are among the worst educational performers, are landed with “a status deficit” and made “to feel as though they are not being given as much recognition and esteem as others”, Goodwin said.

Keir Starmer squared up against Boris Johnson today over the prime minister’s refusal to act on expert advice to impose a national two-week lockdown.

Clinical trials of a potential vaccine for Covid-19 and a treatment for people with severe cases of the disease have been put on hold because of separate safety concerns.

The treatment, produced by US drug company Eli Lilly, is “similar to one taken by US President Donald Trump this month”, says the Financial Times. It involves an infusion of “monoclonal antibodies” - artificially produced cells that mimic the human body’s natural immune response to the coronavirus.

Vaccine breakthrough: how the Pfizer jab compares with its rivals
Results are expected from the Oxford and Moderna trials within weeks

The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Today’s stride towards a safe, effective coronavirus vaccine is that rarest of things: a piece of unquestionably good news. 

And while last week’s US election result has not pleased everyone, it does at least pave the way to some sort of political normality in the world’s only superpower.

Both developments come with a built-in delay - and neither is guaranteed to change the world for the better. But for now, let’s hold on to our hopes of a less tumultuous 2021.

The Pfizer vaccine and its rivals
Stock markets have rocketed on hopes of a breakthrough in the search for a vaccine against Covid-19.

Drugs firm Pfizer saw its shares leap 14% after it said that preliminary analysis indicated that its coronavirus vaccine was 90% effective. The company plans to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of the month.

Its vaccine candidate is one of a handful that are approaching the end of the trial process.

But where a sacrifice would imply the undertaking of a voluntary act of selflessness, the reality is that the government’s whole approach to compliance with its coronavirus restrictions has been based around coercion.”

Is it time the EU took on ‘illiberal democracy’?
Dispute over Covid package deepens divisions
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

British opponents of the EU have often characterised it as a band of elite liberals bent on imposing their permissive values across the continent.

When put to the test, however, Brussels has proved powerless to prevent a sharp rightward turn in both Hungary and Poland - even as their repressive populist governments provoke criticism from more conventional conservative politicians elsewhere in Europe.

Is it time the EU took on ‘illiberal democracy’?
Calls for the European Union to clip the wings of Hungary and Poland have reemerged after the two countries vetoed approval of a Brussels budget and Covid-19 recovery package worth £1.8 trillion.

In a meeting on Monday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki announced that they would block the package citing the EU’s “woke” agenda and perceived interference in domestic politics.

The bloc has repeatedly criticised the countries’ slide towards right-wing authoritarianism over the past decade, during which both have restricted civil liberties and curtailed political dissent.

A company chief executive may be able, at least for a time, to send down diktats that have to be obeyed. But when implementing lockdown and quarantines, ‘command and control’ only takes you so far. Citizens have to be persuaded to follow the rules.”

Oxford vaccine is 70% effective
Third injection joins the battle against coronavirus
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

A third consecutive Monday brings positive news of a vaccine, although in this case not quite the unqualified success we have come to expect.

A month ago, the Oxford vaccine’s 70% protection rate would have been welcomed without reservation. Now, after Pfizer and Moderna’s 95% effective efforts, it looks a little less impressive.

But since the Oxford injection is cheaper and easier to make and distribute, it may yet do more to end the pandemic - especially in poorer countries.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1. Oxford coronavirus vaccine is 70% effective
Results from the Phase 3 trials of a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca have found that it prevents Covid-19 in 70% of people who receive it. The result “is both a triumph and a disappointment”, says the BBC, after two other vaccines, produced by Moderna and Pfizer, protected 95% of recipients. However, the Oxford vaccine is significantly cheaper and easier to distribute.

2. Gyms and shops to re-open when lockdown ends
Boris Johnson is expected to announce later today that gyms and non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen when England’s lockdown ends next month. The 10pm closing time for pubs and restaurants will be relaxed and a ban on outdoor grassroots sport is also set to be lifted on 2 December, but other aspects of the three-tier system are expected to be tightened.

3. Mass testing to tackle post-lockdown outbreaks
The government has announced that mass testing is to be rolled out to areas of England with the highest infection rates after lockdown is lifted. The programme will include an exemption scheme for people who have come into close contact with someone who has Covid-19 but go on to test negative, so they won't have to isolate for 14 days.

4. Ally tells Trump to drop his bid to reverse election results
Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and a leading ally of Donald Trump has called on the US president to drop his efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the presidential election. Christie described Trump’s legal team as a “national embarrassment” and said that “elections have consequences, and we cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn't happen”.

5. Sunak says Covid fallout ‘must be grappled with’
Chancellor Rishi Sinak has said that his planned public sector pay freeze does not signal a return of austerity, and argued that his spending plans will result in more money for health, education and the police. However, he has also warned that people will soon see an “economic shock laid bare,” telling the BBC that record government borrowing to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic must be “grappled with”.

6. Ethiopian PM gives Tigrayan leaders ultimatum
Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister of Ethiopia, has given forces in the northern region of Tigray 72 hours to surrender as government troops advance, warning them that they are “at a point of no return”. The Tigray People's Liberation Front, which controls the mountainous region, insists it will continue to fight. The conflict is thought to have killed hundreds and displaced thousands in recent weeks.

7. Nicolas Sarkozy to face historic corruption trial
The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy is to go on trial accused of corruption and influence-peddling, after allegedly trying to bribe a magistrate in return for information about an investigation into his party finances. The case is the first of several investigations into the man who led France between 2007 and 2012 - and the first former leader to appear in the dock in recent times.

8. Trump lets Israeli spy leave the US
An American navy intelligence figure, who served 30 years in prison for spying for Israel, is expected to leave the US after having his parole terms lifted. The release of Jonathan Pollard, 66, is said to be a gift from the Trump administration - and has caused anger in the intelligence community. “It’s going to be pretty damn annoying if this traitor gets a celebratory hero’s welcome in Tel Aviv,” said a former CIA officer.

9. Ice Bucket challenge founder dies at 37
One of the men behind the viral Ice Bucket Challenge fundraising campaign has died at the age of 37. Patrick Quinn was diagnosed with the incurable neurological disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as motor neurone disease) in 2013. “He was a blessing to us all in so many ways,” said his supporters on his official Facebook page. The campaign has raised more than £16om for ALS research.

10. Bob Dylan letters raise fortune at auction
A collection of Bob Dylan memorabilia including letters, unpublished writing and handwritten lyrics, have sold for nearly half a million dollars at auction. The items, including the lyrics to Blowin’ In The Wind, were put up for sale in a week-long auction run by RR Auction Company. The auction house said its client was “thrilled” with the prices fetched.

“Christmas is saved,” says the Daily Express as Boris Johnson prepares to announce the relaxation of measures so families can meet at Christmas. The Daily Mirror agrees that mingling during the festive season has got the “go ahead” but adds that there are fears that households will spread the virus.

Meanwhile, the Financial Times points out that Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that the UK will have to tackle “the scale of the economic shock” caused by the pandemic.

“We will miss him so much,” is Metro’s headline as it reports on news that Prince William and Kate’s dog Lupo has died. The nine-year-old black cocker spaniel was a wedding present from Kate’s brother, James Middleton.

Why the WHO is warning of a third wave in Europe
Envoy cautions against lifting restrictions too early
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

World leaders are struggling to calibrate their coronavirus messaging amid increasing optimism about vaccines - and fears they might come too late to prevent a third wave.

The UK government hopes that mass testing and a stricter tier system will keep outbreaks under control, but the WHO says further lockdowns may yet be needed.

Why the WHO is warning of a third wave in Europe
Europe may face a third deadly wave of coronavirus in early 2021 if governments lift lockdown measures too early, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Covid-19 envoy has warned.

Speaking to Swiss newspaper Solothurner Zeitung, Dr David Nabarro said that governments had “missed building up the necessary infrastructure during the summer months, after they brought the first wave under control”.

“Now we have the second wave. If they don’t build the necessary infrastructure, we’ll have a third wave early next year,” London-born Nabarro continued. “Another element that is very clear in East Asia is that once you have brought down the case number... you don’t relax the measures.”

Will the Oxford vaccine end the pandemic?
A coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford is between 70% and 90% effective at preventing people from getting Covid-19, according to preliminary data.

Results from Phase 3 trials show that the vaccine, made in partnership with Cambridge-based company AstraZeneca, is 70.4% effective on average. But researchers say that when administered at a half dose and then a full dose, rather than two full doses, the vaccine can be up to 90% effective.

A former deputy secretary of state in Barack Obama’s administration, Blinken has “expressed scepticism about Brexit” and will be tasked with repairing the damage done to US alliances over the past four years, The Times reports.

“Last week’s announcement that defence would receive funding at levels beyond that promised in the Tory manifesto was classic Mr Johnson; how he must have enjoyed sending his somewhat side-lined Defence Secretary Ben Wallace out to face the media with a spring in his step. Nice, too, to brief that NHS workers who saved his life in April would be spared from a public sector wage freeze, as it was for Mr Sunak to airily declare there would be no return to austerity.”

How anti-vaxxers could undermine immunity push
xperts warn that growing wave of scepticism could ruin ‘whole programme’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Before herd immunity became the subject of vitriolic debate, the term usually referred to the benign result of vaccinating most but not all of a population.

We may soon be able to revive that meaning. Or we may just stumble into another argument, about how many people need to get the vaccine before we all benefit - and what to do about those who refuse.

How anti-vaxxers could undermine immunity push
A series of successes in clinical trials is raising hopes that a Covid-19 vaccine will soon be approved by regulators and rolled out to communities worldwide. 

Not everybody is keen to be innoculated against the deadly virus, however, with a growing chorus of anti-vax protesters voicing objections. 

What are anti-vaxxers saying?
Suspicion of vaccinations is nothing new, but with the coronavirus continuing to claim thousands of lives every day, “conspiracy theories and misinformation fuelled by populism and social media threaten to undermine herd immunity”, The Times reports.

Imperial College London epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson, who spearheaded the first UK lockdown, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme last month that while “some people will die because of getting infected” over Christmas, “if it is only one or two days, the impact is likely to be limited”.

1. Paul Ormerod in City AM
“Fines or even prison could be applied in vaccine refusers who are shown to have spread Covid. But such measures would create the wrong sort of climate. The best incentives in the current circumstances are positive ones. The idea being floated of a “vaccine passport” that would enable immunised people to experience more freedom in their day-to-day lives might work, though it would immediately create a market in forgeries. But there is a much simpler way: people should be paid when they get vaccinated.”

Rishi Sunak’s public sector pay freeze slammed by unions
Firefighters, police, teachers and local authority staff hit by pay standstill
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

When considering Rishi Sunak’s meteoric rise, it is perhaps worth remembering comic Caroline Aherne’s famous quip to Debbie McGee, wife of television magician Paul Daniels.

“So what first attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?”

While dolling out funds to support Britain through the pandemic, Sunak’s popularity has risen beyond that even of Boris Johnson. But as reality bites, the Conservative’s rising star may soon become the face of a series of painful cuts.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1. Sunak’s public sector pay freeze slammed by unions
Unions have described a pay freeze for millions of UK workers as “a kick in the teeth”, after Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that he would “pause” pay rises for workers including firefighters, police, teachers and local authority staff. The GMB union said it would “hit key workers who have risked everything during the pandemic”, while the Trades Union Congress said it added to “a decade of standstill pay”.

2. Joe Biden fires Brexit warning at Boris Johnson
Joe Biden has ratcheted up the pressure on Boris Johnson to agree a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union, reiterating his belief that there can be no hard border on the island of Ireland. The president-elect said he had talked to Johnson and EU figures to restate his opposition to a hard border, adding the “idea of having a border north and south once again being closed is just not right”.

3. Football stars pay tribute to ‘beautiful’ Diego Maradona
Tributes have been pouring in for footballing legend Diego Maradona who died yesterday at the age of 60. “To be Diego Maradona was incredibly beautiful”, said Argentine teammate Ossie Ardilles. Brazilian football star Pele said he hoped one day they would “play ball together in the sky”. Maradona’s body will lie in state at the Casa Rosada, the seat of the Argentina government, during three days of mourning.

4. Hancock to outline new post-lockdown tier system
The majority of England will enter the two toughest tiers of Boris Johnson’s new Covid restrictions from next week. The tiered system will be stricter than the previous one, with more local authorities placed under harsh restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out the plans in the Commons today, with a review of the rules promised by 16 December amid signs of a growing Conservative rebellion.

5. Over-55s losing trust in the BBC
Older, more well-off viewers are slowly falling out of love with the BBC, Ofcom has revealed. The regulator said Britons spent an average of two hours and 22 minutes a day with the national broadcaster’s television, radio and digital services last year, down 19 minutes since 2017. The proportion of over-55s with a positive impression of the BBC, however, has slipped from 64% to 62% in two years.

6. Controversy as Trump pardons ex-aide Michael Flynn
Donald Trump has pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The White House said that the pardon would finally end “the relentless, partisan pursuit of an innocent man”. Flynn admitted to lying to the FBI about contacts with Russia’s envoy in 2017, but had tried to withdraw his plea. Trump is expected to pardon a string of key aides before he leaves office.

7. Lawyer complains Ghislaine Maxwell is woken every 15 minutes
Ghislaine Maxwell is being woken every 15 minutes in jail to check that she is alive, according to a letter filed by her attorney. Bobbi Sternheim claims that “despite non-stop in-cell camera surveillance”, Maxwell’s sleep is “disrupted every 15 minutes when she is awakened by a flashlight”. Maxwell stands accused of facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of girls. She has pleaded not guilty.

8. Marcus Rashford to receive special BBC gong
Manchester United and England star Marcus Rashford will be honoured with a special award at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. The honour will recognise Rashford’s campaigning against child poverty and in support of free school meals. The 23-year-old had been excluded from the main nominees as his on-field achievements have not reached the sporting bar required by the judging panel.

9. Covid dethrones London as ‘most connected’ city
Shanghai has beaten London to claim the title of the world’s most connected city. Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, London has seen a 67% fall in connectivity in air travel, according to the International Air Transport Association. The top four most connected cities in the world are now all in China: Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Chengdu.

10. Great Ormond Street Hospital porter faces sex charges
A porter at Great Ormond Street Hospital has been charged with 84 child sex offences alleged to have been carried out over the course of three decades. The Metropolitan Police say Paul Farrell, 55, targeted victims between 1985 and 2018.

MPs to debate tiered Covid restrictions
Bill is likely to pass - but Labour will abstain
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Labour will not vote with the government to introduce new coronavirus restrictions this evening - the first time it is withholding support.

Nor will Keir Starmer oppose the rules outright. Instead his party will abstain - a move he says is calibrated to express doubts about the government’s testing and economic support strategy  without blocking attempts to control the “serious threat” posed by Covid-19.

The absence of Labour votes will also serve to lay bare Conservative divisions about the PM’s approach.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1. Commons expected to approve tiers despite Tory uprising
MPs are preparing to vote on the government's proposals for stricter tiers of coronavirus restrictions across England. Although up to 50 Tory MPs are expected to rebel, the vote is still expected to pass. Labour will abstain - the first time during the pandemic that Keir Starmer will not support the government in a key vote. More than 55 million people will enter the two toughest tiers from on Wednesday if the plans are approved.

2. Amazon deforestation ‘soars to a 12-year high’
Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has surged to its highest level since 2008. Inpe, the country’s space agency, says a total of 4,281 square miles of rainforest were destroyed between August 2019 and July 2020 - a 9.5% increase from the previous year. The carbon store in the Amazon slows down the pace of global warming.

3. Green’s ‘failure’ as Arcadia enters administration
Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group collapsed into administration yesterday, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. The owner of household names including Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Burton appointed administrators from Deloitte, which protects Arcadia from creditors while a buyer is sought for all or parts of the company. The Guardian says Green’s high street career has ended “in failure”.

4. Grenfell insulation chief ‘sneered at safety concerns’
A boss at a firm whose flammable insulation was fitted on Grenfell Tower said that customers concerned about the safety of the product could “go f*** themselves”, a public inquiry has heard. The Grenfell Tower inquiry was told that Kingspan marketed its product as suitable for buildings above 18 metres tall despite not having safety data to back up the claim.

5. Venues may turn unvaccinated customers away
Restaurants, bars, sporting venues and cinemas may turn customers away if they have not had the Covid-19 jab, according to the new minister for the mass vaccine roll-out. Nadhim Zahawi said the vaccine would be “voluntary” but added that “the very strong message” is that the jab is “the way we return the whole country to normal”.

6. Trump’s Covid adviser quits after four months
Donald Trump’s controversial special adviser on the coronavirus, Dr Scott Atlas, has resigned. During his four months in the role, Atlas questioned the need for lockdowns, masks and other safety measures. Announcing he would step down, he said the US president had “always relied on the latest science and evidence without any political consideration or influence”.

7. Star says Crown has ‘responsibility’ to state it’s drama
Helena Bonham Carter says The Crown has a “moral responsibility” to tell viewers that it is a drama, rather than historical fact. Following clamour for a “health warning” for people watching the series, the actress, who plays Princess Margaret, said there is an important distinction between “our version”, and the “real version” of royal history.

8. Secret dossier gives ‘granular’ detail on Covid impact
The government has assembled a secret file detailing the impact of Covid-19 on the economy, with a dozen sectors rated “red” and facing significant job cuts and revenue losses. The Times says it gives “granular” detail on the effect of coronavirus on nearly 40 areas of the economy. Separately, ministers have published an assessment of the health, social and economic impacts of coronavirus.

9. Bitcoin reaches new high as ‘wild year’ concludes
The cryptocurrency Bitcoin surged by 9% to a new all-time high of about $19,860 on Monday, topping the previous peak of $19,783 from December 2017. It has risen by more than 175% since the end of 2019 in what CNN describes as a “wild year”. However, in March prices plunged below $4,000 as markets around the globe sank due to the Covid-19 economic crisis.

10. Rita Ora offers to pay fine after party broke lockdown rules
Pop singer Rita Ora has volunteered to pay a £10,000 fine after breaking English lockdown rules to celebrate her 30th birthday. It is reported that up to 30 people attended a party at a restaurant in west London on Saturday. “Given the restrictions, I realise how irresponsible these actions were and I take full responsibility,” she wrote in a statement.

The Guardian reports that NHS bosses are planning to enlist the help of “very sensible” celebrities and social media influencers to persuade people to have a Covid vaccine.

The Daily Mirror amplifies retail chiefs’ plea to the public to “Go shop for Britain” as experts say retailers face a £9bn slump in pre-Christmas takings. Non-essential stores in England re-open on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Jeremy Clarkson complains in the i paper that Brexit has “buggered my barley”. The broadcaster says uncertainty over the future of Britain’s relationship with the EU is causing worries for his crop of the cereal.

How the UK could end HIV transmission by 2030
Wider testing ‘could halt new transmissions’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

As coronavirus spread through Britain in the spring, sexual health clinics spoke of a potential opportunity. 

The sudden reduction in new sexual partnerships brought about by lockdown, combined with effective treatments and preventatives, could accelerate us towards the post-HIV era, they said. 

Now there are hopes that some of the lessons learned during the Covid pandemic will speed up the process still further.

How the UK could end HIV transmission by 2030
As the world grapples with the effects of Covid-19, a more protracted battle against a pandemic that has claimed far more lives continues to be fought.

To mark World Aids Day, campaigners are renewing calls for the government to honour an existing commitment to eliminate HIV transmission in the UK by 2030.

Medical science has already made massive headway in tackling the virus. As Deutsche Welle notes, “for most people, an HIV diagnosis in the 1980s was an automatic death sentence”. Four decades later, the NHS says life expectancy averages for HIV-positive patients are “near normal”. But is eradication really in reach?

Should pubs and airlines require vaccine passports?
Restaurants, bars and cinemas will begin to reopen across the UK this week following the end of lockdown as the government steps up plans for the mass rollout of Covid-19 vaccinations.

But the minister in charge of overseeing the vaccine programme has triggered controversy by suggesting that while having the jabs will not be compulsary, leisure venues including sports stadiums may turn away customers who haven’t been innoculated against the coronavirus.

Labour MPs will withhold their support when the Commons votes on Boris Johnson’s new, stricter system of tiered coronavirus restrictions later this evening - the first time that the opposition has not backed government proposals for tackling the pandemic.

Party leader Keir Starmer says he can no longer support the prime minister in the absence of “a functioning testing system” and “effective economic support” for businesses, even though he wants the new rules to become law.

Covid-19 vaccinations begin on UK’s ‘V-Day’
70 hubs across the UK preparing to give the jab
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

History was made this morning when 90-year-old Margaret Keenan became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine outside trial conditions.

While most of the UK was still dozing, Keenan was given the vaccine by nurse May Parsons at Coventry’s University Hospital at 6:31am.

Keenan said being first was “a privilege” and will return to the hospital in 21 days to receive a booster jab to ensure protection against the virus.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1. Covid-19 vaccinations begin on UK’s ‘V-Day’
At risk patients in the UK will begin receiving the coronavirus jab today, on what has been dubbed “V-Day” by newspapers. About 70 hospital hubs across the UK are preparing to give the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to over-80s, as well as some health and care staff. Among the first to receive the jab wil be Hari and Ranjan Shukla from Newcastle, both in their 80s. Hari said he was “excited” to get the vaccination.

2. Johnson heads to Brussels as negotiations get ‘tricky’
Boris Johnson will travel to Brussels for a face-to-face summit with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a final push to break the deadlock in the Brexit negotiations. A UK government source said “things are looking very tricky”, while MPs last night voted to reinstate contentious sections of the Internal Markets Bill, overriding sections of the Withdrawal Agreement.

3. Afghan civilians killed by US soar by 330%
The number of Afghan civilians killed in airstrikes carried out by the US and its allies has soared by 330% since 2017, researchers have revealed. The Costs of War Project, based at Brown University, says that in 2019 alone, around 700 civilians were killed. The figure marks the highest number of deaths since the first years of the US invasion after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.

4. Government to raise age limit for National Lottery
The age limit for playing the National Lottery will be raised from 16 to 18 from next October. The move is part of the government’s “major and wide-ranging review” of the gambling sector, which could see betting firms face limits on online stakes, restrictions on advertising and a ban on football sponsorship. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the review will tackle “problem gambling in all its forms”.

5. Taxman warns Brexit will create £7.5bn ‘admin burden’
British businesses will face an annual “administrative burden” of £7.5bn after the Brexit transition period, the chief executive of HMRC has warned. Thousands of businesses trading with the EU after the transition period ends on 31 December will be required to fill in customs declarations for the first time. Jim Harra said he expected 265 million declarations in the UK each year, an increase of 211 million.

6. Breakdancing ‘makes mockery’ of Olympic Games
Including breakdancing in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games will make a “mockery” of the event, a sporting legend has warned. Breakdancing will be called “breaking” when competitors take to the floor and was proposed two years ago after trials at the 2018 Youth Olympics. “Yes they’re trying to move with the times but it’s creating a mockery of the thing,” said Australian squash great Michelle Martin.

7. First man to break sound barrier dies at 97
Chuck Yeager, the American test pilot who became the first person to break the sound barrier in 1947, has died at the age of 97. “It is [with] profound sorrow, I must tell you that my life love General Chuck Yeager passed just before 9pm ET,” his wife Victoria said in a tweet. Yeager, who was immortalised through a cameo in The Right Stuff, was widely considered one of America’s greatest ever fighter pilots.

8. Millwall will not ‘take the knee’ at future matches
Millwall FC players will not take a knee before this evening’s fixture against QPR, instead standing arm-in-arm in a “show of solidarity for football’s fight against discrimination”. Millwall’s regular shirt sponsor will also be replaced with the logo of anti-discrimination body Kick It Out. The decision comes after some Millwall fans booed the players taking a knee before Saturday’s defeat by Derby County.

9. Ikea to scrap famous catalogue
Ikea is phasing out its iconic annual catalogue after 70 years. The Swedish retailer said in a statement that it has “taken the emotional but rational decision to respectfully end the successful career” of the print and digital versions of the catalogue. Coming just four months after Argos announced it was scrapping its catalogue, the plan follows an increasing shift to online browsing and shopping.

10. Bob Dylan sells copyright to his back catalogue
Bob Dylan has sold the copyright for his entire back catalogue of music to a global media conglomerate.

Last week, former Fleetwood Mac songstress Stevie Nicks sold her catalogue in a $100m (£74.9m) deal.

The mass vaccination campaign begins
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Military metaphors may lack subtlety, but they have their uses - and today really does feel like the day we launched the offensive phase of our struggle against the coronavirus.

There are good reasons to be cautious. New coronavirus infections, which had been falling rapidly, seem to have levelled off. Deaths are falling, but slowly. And Christmas could give the virus new ways to spread. 

In other words, we can’t let down our defences yet, and should prepare for retreats as well as advances. But at least now the virus doesn’t hold all the weapons.

Does ‘V-Day’ mark the end of the pandemic?
A 90-year-old woman has become the the first person in the world to be vaccinated against Covid-19 outside of a clinical trial, as the largest mass vaccination drive in NHS history kicks off on what Health Secretary Matt Hancock has dubbed “V-Day”.

Grandmother-of-four Margaret Keenan received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at 6.31am today at her local hospital in Coventry, after the UK government last week became the first to approve the jab for public use. Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said it was “the best early birthday present I could wish for” .

 “I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of the year,” she added.

Chance of Brexit deal ‘very slim’ as PM flies to Brussels
Johnson will arrive in Brussels today
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Yesterday’s agreement resolving UK and EU differences on the Irish border, which led the British government to drop its threat to break international law, might have given the impression that a broader deal was imminent.

This morning, both sides are steering reporters away from that conclusion. They say Boris Johnson’s dinner with Ursula von der Leyen this evening really will be make or break.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1. Chance of Brexit deal ‘very slim’ as PM flies to Brussels
Boris Johnson will arrive in Brussels today for post-Brexit trade talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The EU’s chief negotiator has warned the chance of a deal is now “very slim”. If there is no breakthrough at the dinner this evening a no-deal Brexit would be likely. However, Downing Street said that if the discussion goes well, negotiations could resume on Friday.

2. Biden pledges 100m vaccinations in first 100 days
The US president-elect Joe Biden, who takes office in January, has set a target of delivering 100 million Covid vaccinations in his first 100 days in office. “My first 100 days won’t end the Covid-19 virus” he said. “I can't promise that. We did not get into this mess quickly. We're not going to get out of it quickly.” A report has paved the way for a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be approved and rolled out for Americans.

3. Sir Patrick Vallance warns of another year of masks
The public may have to wear masks for another year, despite the start of Britain’s national vaccination programme, Sir Patrick Vallance has warned. The chief scientific adviser said: “It may be that next winter even with vaccination we need measures such as masks in place. We don't know yet how good all the vaccines are going to be at preventing the transmission of the virus.”

4. Mass strike in India over new farming laws
Farmers across India are on strike in a dispute over new agriculture laws, with thousands blocking key roads on the edge of New Delhi. The industrial action follows three rounds of inconclusive talks between the two sides over laws that farmers say are against their interests. The governing Bharatiya Janata Party insists the reforms, which allow private players a greater role in the farming sector, will not harm farmers.

5. Five dead after helicopter crashes in Alps
A helicopter has crashed in the French Alps killing five of the six people on board. The private aircraft was carrying out a rescue mission when it went down near the town of Bonvillard in the Savoie area. Officials say the crash could have been caused by poor weather conditions. France's air accident bureau said that it had opened an investigation.

6. Old Etonians defend sacking of ‘misogynistic’ teacher
Former Eton pupils have supported the school for sacking a teacher they accuse of promoting the idea that “men are violent and women are compliant”. A group of former pupils urged the institution not to reinstate Will Knowland, who was dismissed after refusing to delete a video which set out his rebuff to feminism, sparking a row about free speech. Writing to The Times, they say the decision to sack Knowland was justified by the “intellectually feeble, misogynistic and vitriolic nature” of the video.

7. England rugby ace joins dementia group action
Rugby legend Steve Thompson has been diagnosed with early onset dementia and is joining a group of former players in a potentially landmark legal action for the sport. Thompson, who won the Rugby World Cup with England in 2003, said he cannot remember winning the trophy and would not want his own children to play the game “the way it is at the moment”.

8. Grenfell insulation workers ‘joked about safety’
Employees at the insulation firm behind one of the flammable materials used on Grenfell Tower joked about how their product was not fully tested before being classed as fire safe, an inquiry has heard. Referring to a safety benchmark in instant messages, Arron Chalmers told his colleague Pete Moss that the insulation “doesn't actually get Class 0 when we test the whole product tho LOL!” Moss also described it as a “s**t product”.

9. Two millions British families to be pushed in poverty
Destitution levels in Great Britain are expected to double in the wake of the pandemic, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The study forecasts two million families, including a million children, will struggle to afford to feed themselves, stay warm, or keep clean as the Covid-driven recession deepens. It adds that government polices were driving sharp rises in extreme poverty even before Covid struck.

10. European football tie abandoned after racism storm
Paris St-Germain's game against Istanbul Basaksehir was called off last night when a match official was accused of using a racist term towards one of the away side’s backroom staff. The Turkish club's players protested after their Cameroonian assistant coach Pierre Webo was shown a red card in the 16th minute of the game. Uefa said the game would resume today, adding it “will be conducting a thorough investigation”.

‘One down…54m to go’
“One small jab for Maggie…one giant leap for all of us,” is the Daily Express’s front page headline as it covers the start of the UK’s mass vaccination programme. “One down…54m to go,” is the Daily Mirror’s splash on the same story, but The Daily Telegraph reports a warning that we may have to wear masks for another year.

The Times leads on Boris Johnson’s “last ditch push” for a Brexit deal, quoting one government source as saying “we must be realistic that an agreement may not be possible”. The i newspaper describes today as a “showdown” on the “future of the UK”

Meanwhile, The Guardian reports that England rugby legend Steve Thompson has been diagnosed with early onset dementia and is joining a group of ex-players who are proposing to bring legal action.

Chaos expected as France shuts border
PM will chair a Cobra meeting as lorries back up
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Travel chaos resulting from the closure of French ports is one of the few developments we might have predicted at the beginning of the year, especially if we’d known that a Brexit deal would still be eluding negotiators four days before Christmas.

What would have been surprising is the reason: a new and particularly virulent form of a virus that has already caused unprecedented harm.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . Chaos expected as France shuts border
Boris Johnson will chair a meeting of the government's emergency committee after France closed its border with the UK for 48 hours in response to the fast-spreading new strain of Covid-19. No lorries or ferry passengers will be able to sail from the port of Dover, leading to travel chaos. Manston Airport in Kent is being prepared to accommodate up to 4,000 lorries.

2 . Brexit teams miss deadline
Brexit trade talks continue this week after negotiators failed to reach an agreement over the weekend. Negotiators edged closer to a compromise on fishing rights but missed the European Parliament’s deadline. This raises the prospect of weeks without arrangements from 1 January even if an agreement is reached, The Guardian reports.

3 . Retail chiefs beg Sunak for help
Shop bosses are urging the chancellor to extend a business rates holiday amid fears that new coronavirus measures could put thousands of jobs at risk. After non-essential retailers were ordered to shut under new Tier 4 restrictions, industry executives called for help from Rishi Sunak. The Daily Telegraph says the “beleaguered industry” is forecast to suffer a further £2bn of lost sales per week.

4 . Israeli spyware ‘hacked phones’ for UAE
An Israeli private intelligence firm’s spyware was used to hack the phones of dozens of Al Jazeera journalists, claim leading researchers. The experts at the University of Toronto said they discovered what appears to be a major espionage campaign against one of the world’s leading media organisations, ordered by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

5 . PM ‘delayed Christmas move to avoid vote’
A senior Conservative MP says Boris Johnson deliberately waited until parliament was no longer sitting to “cancel Christmas”. Sir Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, pointed out that MPs had voted on the original arrangements for the Christmas relaxation. He added: “The view of most colleagues was that, to be changed, another vote would be required in the House of Commons.”

6 . Boeing 737 cleared by safety regulator
The executive director of Europe's aviation safety agency says he is “certain” Boeing’s 737 Max is now safe to fly. Patrick Ky insisted his organisation had “left no stone unturned” in its review of the jet and its analysis of design changes made by the manufacturer. The aircraft was grounded in March 2019 after two accidents in which a total of 346 people died.

7 . Rise in terror arrests during 2020
The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a spike in the number of children being arrested for terrorism, say police. A total of 17 under-18s were arrested in the year to September 2020 compared with 11 in the year to September 2019. Police say the pandemic is promoting a climate for lonely young people to be drawn to terror groups.

8 . India crowns new Miss Transqueen
Fashion designer Shaine Soni has been named India’s Miss Transqueen at the country’s beauty pageant for transgender women. She will represent India at next year’s Miss International Queen, the world’s biggest pageant for transgender women. Soni was born biologically male but she identified as a girl from a young age.

9 . Pandemic helps us sleep longer
The Covid-19 pandemic means people are finally getting the right amount of sleep, according to a British scientist. Analysis from a sleep-tracking app found users had woken up much later on average after March 2020 than they did last year, while their bedtimes did not significantly change. People are staying in bed for around an hour later.

10 . Hamilton named BBC sport personality
Lewis Hamilton has been voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2020. The Formula 1 world champion equalled Michael Schumacher's record of seven world titles with his fourth consecutive championship in 2020. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson finished second in the public vote while jockey Hollie Doyle came in third. “I want to say congratulations to all the incredible nominees,” said Hamilton.

The science behind delaying the second dose
Two doses of the Covid vaccine ‘essential’ - but timing may not be
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

While Britain has relatively low rates of vaccine scepticism - certainly compared with France -  the government is anxious not to undermine that confidence.

It will be reassured, then, to hear that several other countries are now also planning to increase the gap between doses of the Covid vaccine, which will allow more people to be protected more quickly.

vaccine strategy
The science behind delaying the second dose
Governments and health experts worldwide are considering whether to follow the UK in inoculating as many people as possible against Covid by giving them each just one dose rather than two.

The debate has been raging since the end of December, when Boris Johnson’s government announced plans to postpone giving the second dose of both the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines by up to 12 weeks.  

Denmark has now unveiled plans to delay the second dose of both the Pfizer and forthcoming Moderna jabs by up to six weeks, and Germany is considering a similar move.

Lockdown-sceptic Conservative MPs in retreat
MPs are expected to approve Boris Johnson’s new Covid restrictions this evening as Conservative lockdown sceptics back down in the face of spiralling infection rates.

When MPs last voted on coronavirus measures, on 1 December, 55 of the prime minister’s backbenchers voted against the introduction of a tiered system of restrictions. But newly published data from the Office of National Statistics that suggests one in 50 people in England are currently infected with the coronavirus has prompted many of the rebels to think again.

Is Starmer ‘Captain Hindsight’ on Covid?
Keir Starmer is living up to the “Captain Hindsight” nickname handed to him by Boris Johnson by pre-empting the government’s policies with public calls for tighter Covid restrictions, critics claim.

The Labour leader insisted during a television interview on Monday that schools should be shut in order to curb soaring infection rates - a demand that came “an hour after Downing Street had briefed journalists that an announcement was coming that evening”, Politico London Playbook’s Alex Wickham reports.

Addressing the first congress since 2016 of the ruling Workers’ Party, Kim admitted that “almost all sectors fell a long way short of the set objectives” of the five-year plan, which ended last month.

Varkeychan, your recap of all stories published this week at The Ken India‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌
Good Morning Varkeychan,
 
What a week it has been for cricket fans. Even if you’re not a fan of the sport, I’m willing to wager that you set aside some time on Tuesday to celebrate a hard-fought Indian victory Down Under. I know I did, but then, I’m a cricket fan(atic).
 
Let's sidestep the ‘Lessons for leaders from India’s victory’, it’s all over social media anyway. Instead, let me draw your attention to the parallels drawn by ESPNCricinfo’s senior editor Sharda Ugra between the regenerative ability of many creatures in the natural world and the Indian cricket team’s regeneration during this tour. Much like them, some of the stories that our writers at The Ken took on this week also had a regenerative tinge to it.
 
Take Bhumika’s story that we kicked off the week with. The hotels, restaurants, and catering (HoReCa) space was left reeling by the pandemic. Earlier projections of the industry being worth $754 billion by 2022 now seemed far-fetched. To survive, the B2B food sector shifted lanes to B2C. Some companies are finding their path, but others’ futures are still hanging in the balance. It’s a fascinating read.
 
On Wednesday, Olina wrote about the accountability crisis brewing behind the scenes of one of India’s oldest business schools, the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIM-C). So much so that it has impacted IIM-C’s annual spend on research—it went from $81,000 to $9,500, something that should set alarm bells ringing.  
 
As one of the IIM-C faculty members said, “If you had the same budget, would you now choose IIM-C over NUS in Singapore? I don’t think so.” Unless it can regenerate itself, of course. IIM-C is also our CEO Rohin’s alma mater; maybe you should write to him or tweet at him and ask how he feels about all this.
 
Just like India’s victory resulted from a fabulous team effort, we had great collaborative and cross-country stories this week.
 
On Tuesday, Seetharaman teamed up with our illustrator Sharath and contributor Sunny Sabharwal to break down foodtech giant Zomato’s financial game. The company’s food delivery business (B2C), like similar businesses globally, saw its fortunes swing upwards after an initial hiccup. But as it prepares itself for an IPO, has it done enough regeneration of its businesses to get the investors to salivate?
 
You know how stay-at-home orders last year meant that we turned to the safety of our mobile screens to keep us connected and entertained? So, on Thursday, Jum from the Philippines, Jon from Thailand, and our designer Prajakta from India decided to piece together the little numbers caught in between the big picture in Southeast Asia’s mobile app scene. If you didn’t know that people in SEA collectively spent an amount of time that roughly equalled 110,350 years just binging content on video streaming apps, then you’re in for a treat.
 
We capped off the week with a free story when three of our stellar reporters—Pratap, Maitri, and Olina—put their brains together to find out what’s happening with India’s vaccination drive against Covid-19. It’s not about the cold chain or the logistics to inoculate its 1.3 billion citizens, but about the app at the centre of it all. CoWIN has been glitchy, unpredictable, and it is also sparking serious privacy concerns. It’s supposed to be like the axe in Abraham Lincoln’s famous quote, “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” Except that CoWIN is still blunt.  
 
Before I let you go, here’s another wonderful cricket story by Mukul Kesavan, featuring the butterfly in Brisbane. If you watched the game, you’ll know what I’m referring to. If not, read it and find out. And then take another moment to relive the victory. That final drive down the ground is likely to remain etched in my memory for a long time, the same way that six that sealed the World Cup win a decade ago has remained.
 
I’m going to indulge myself with the highlights from these matches again today. I hope you enjoy the rest of your Sunday too.
 
Cheers,
Nithin

		You want to eat less meat and more plants, but you’re not sure where to start. I get it—and I'm here to help. First, upgrade old faves—think curry or cauliflower rice—by swapping the meat for protein-rich, plant-based ingredients, and loading up on flavorful accents (like sriracha and fresh ginger). Need a substitute for chicken broth? You probably already have it in your pantry. Read on for more tips—we bet you won't even miss the meat.

What the Novavax results mean for the UK
Approval would leave UK with millions of excess doses
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

After Tuesday’s bleak news about the UK death toll, we end the week with a flurry of encouraging developments.

Two more vaccines proved themselves effective against Covid - one of them after a single dose. The other needs two doses, but is the first to prove that it works against the Kent variant of the virus.

In the short term, though, the most positive news of all may be “very promising” data about the 7.9 million UK residents who have already received the vaccine.

What the Novavax results mean for the UK
Britain’s Covid vaccines rollout is on course to get a fresh boost after a new jab was found to be 89.3% effective in large-scale UK trials.

The UK has already secured 60 million doses of the Novavax vaccine, which will now be assessed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and could be “delivered in the second half of this year” if approved, the BBC reports.

Stan Erck, chief executive of Novavax, said the results from the UK phase three trial were “spectacular” and “as good as we could have hoped”.

The Harris survey, modelled on the run-off Macron won in 2017, says that Le Pen would have 48% of the vote, with Macron on 52%, placing the odds of a victory for the challenger well within the margin of error.

1. Ross Clark in The Daily Telegraph
“There is no point in merely adding to what, in a few months’ time, will be a vast vaccine mountain - when AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax have fulfilled their orders we will have enough to vaccinate every adult in Britain four times over. What we really need to be doing now is looking ahead to round two of the vaccine programme: updating the drugs to keep up with all-known variants of the virus.”

Reddit vs. Wall Street: the new battleground
Small-time investors are now targeting silver
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Hedge fund managers are flocking to “foul-mouthed online message boards” to inform their investment strategies, according to the Financial Times - perhaps a little testy after being jilted by its own natural audience.

The latest target for the online activists is silver, which has been pushed to an eight-year high. Unlike last week’s efforts to rally around a games retailer, this sudden surge of interest in precious metals could have real-world consequences.

Reddit vs. Wall Street: the new battleground
The price of silver has hit a five-month high as the online trading war between Reddit users and Wall Street hedge funds spills over into the precious metals market.  

Last week, shares in struggling US video-games retailer GameStop skyrocketed after Reddit forum WallStreetBets took on huge hedge funds that were betting against the stock. The war between short sellers and the band of private investors has seen GameStop’s share price jump by 1,700% in the space of a month. 

Now, small-time investors on WallStreetBets are teaming up to pump their money in silver, in what appears to be a fresh bid “to hurt big banks they believe are artificially suppressing prices”, says CNN.

covid truce
Have the UK and EU avoided a vaccine war?
So what happened on Friday evening? Political pundits are still scratching their heads after the EU was and then wasn’t set to control Covid vaccine exports to Ireland, before describing any threat to do so an “oversight”.

Although the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products, Article 16 of the deal acts as a get-out clause if the protocol could lead to serious “economic, societal or environmental difficulties”.

“Now righteous anger on behalf of Britain’s locked-down young is the new stick to beat older generations with. The pitting of baby boomers against millennials is nothing new, of course. Never mind how hard those in their sixties, seventies or eighties worked for their comforts, they are routinely held as responsible for twentysomethings’ housing woes, stagnating wages and environmental concerns - as though they were part of a conscious gerontocratic conspiracy to short-change young people.”

Rishi Sunak says experts ‘moving goalposts’ on lockdown
Chancellor believes UK approach point of lifting lockdown for good
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Chris Whitty last night told the daily press briefing that the UK is “past the peak” of the latest Covid wave. But those waiting for a hasty end to lockdown shouldn’t hold their breath.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak is growing increasingly concerned that the experts are using lockdowns to “keep cases down overall”, rather than to protect the most vulnerable, allies say.

However, with Whitty also warning that “another peak” is possible, those aims may not be totally distinct from one another.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . Sunak says experts ‘moving goalposts’
Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told allies that he fears scientific advisers are “moving the goalposts” on when to end the lockdown. Sunak believes that Britain is approaching a “fat lady sings moment” when lockdown must be lifted for good, The Telegraph says. However, he is concerned that scientists have replaced the target of protecting the NHS and saving lives with a focus on driving case numbers down. An ally told the paper: “Rishi remains where he has been throughout the pandemic – he is pro opening as quickly and as safely as possible.”

2 . UK trials mixing vaccines
The UK is launching a study to see if giving people different Covid vaccines for their first and second doses works as well - or better than - the current approach of using the same jab twice. Scientists have pointed out that Ebola immunisation programmes involve mixing different jabs to enhance protection. The Com-Cov study, run by the National Immunisation Schedule Evaluation Consortium, will involve more than 800 volunteers over the age of 50 in England. Those not involved in the trial will continue to receive the same vaccine at both appointments.

3 . US ‘disturbed’ by Uighur report
The US government has said it is “deeply disturbed” by reports of systematic rape and sexual torture of women in China’s Uighur detention camps. Several former detainees told the BBC “they experienced or saw evidence of an organised system of mass rape, sexual abuse and torture”. A US state department spokesperson said: “These atrocities shock the conscience and must be met with serious consequences.” China’s foreign ministry, meanwhile, moved to strongly deny the “false report”.

4 . World’s first double transplant
Doctors in New York have completed the world’s first successful face and double hand transplant. Joe DiMeo, 22, from New Jersey, underwent a 23-hour surgery after suffering third-degree burns over 80% of his body in a car accident. A medical team of more than 140 experts transplanted a full face, as well as amputating both of DiMeo’s hands and replacing them mid-forearm. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime gift, and I hope the family can take some comfort knowing that part of the donor lives on with me”, DiMeo said.

5 . UN calls on leaders to act against coup
The UN secretary general has pledged to rally enough international pressure on Myanmar’s military “to make sure that this coup fails”. António Guterres described the reversal of elections as “unacceptable”, adding that he would call on “key actors and [the] international community” to stop the snatching of power. The UN Security Council is discussing a possible statement, however, China is expected to block any wording that condemns the coup.

6 . Johnson to tax meat and cheese
Consumers could face paying higher prices for meat, cheese and gas heating under plans being drawn up for new carbon taxes and charges. Boris Johnson has ordered every Whitehall department to produce a “price” for carbon emissions across all areas of the economy. The carbon reduction blueprint is expected to be announced in the run-up to Cop26, the UN climate change conference being hosted in Glasgow in November.

7 . Coughing Covid a ‘greater risk than thought’
Covid patients’ coughing puts NHS frontline staff in more danger than previously thought, a study has found. The research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that coughing generated at least 10 times more infectious “aerosol” particles than speaking or breathing. The news has led to fresh demands that those caring for Covid patients should be provided with PPE that stops even the smallest virus-carrying droplets. The study also suggests that hospital ventilation should be improved.

8 . Beckham-backed cannabis venture floats
A company that uses compounds found in cannabis to make skincare and athletic products plans to float on the London Stock Exchange. Cellular Goods is part of a growing market for products that use chemicals found in cannabis for skin regimes and has sold a minority stake to DB Ventures, David Beckham’s investment firm. The former Manchester United and England star “is understood to believe that the use of CBD in consumer goods is an attractive growth prospect for his investment portfolio”, Sky News says.

9 . ‘Pathetic’ Whitty heckler condemned
A young man who berated Chris Whitty in the street has been condemned by the chief medical officer. In a video of the incident, the man can be heard telling Whitty: “You’re lying about the Covid-19 cases man. C’mon man, stop lying to the TV man.” Health Secretary Matt Hancock branded the heckler “pathetic”, while Whitty told the daily press briefing: “I’m sure he’ll become a model citizen in due course and hopefully more like Captain Tom, who is the kind of person who I think much more exemplifies the spirit of the UK.”

10 . Olympics chief said women talk too much
The head of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics organising committee has conceded that he may have to resign after making sexist remarks about “talkative” female sports officials. Yoshiro Mori, a former Japanese prime minister with a history of colourful remarks, told a meeting of the Japanese Olympic Committee that meetings attended by too many women tended to “drag on” because they talked too much.

Today’s newspapers
‘We’re past the peak’
Leading on the words of England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, the Metro this morning splashes on the headline: “We’re past the peak.” Whitty gave the verdict after one month of lockdown in England, adding: “That doesn’t mean you can never have another peak... [but] we’re on a downward slope of cases, hospitalisations and deaths in all four nations.”

The Daily Mail leads on Boris Johnson’s support for the erection of a statue of Captain Tom Moore, while the Daily Mirror features NHS nurses, paramedics and doctors applauding last night under the headline: “This is for Captain Tom”.

The Times reports that Boris Johnson will levy a new carbon tax on meat, cheese and gas heating. The plan is part of the run-up to the UN climate change conference being hosted by Britain in November.

Dear Varkeychan,

Today’s newspaper front pages are the most optimistic we’ve seen since the discovery of the Kent coronavirus variant before Christmas.

While there’s little doubt that vaccines are changing the rules of the game, it may be a sign of our diminished expectations that the idea of outdoor dining at the end of March is generating quite such enthusiasm.

hope springs eternal
The restrictions lined up to be lifted by May
The lockdown in England will begin to lift within weeks under “tentative” plans being drawn up by ministers hoping for a “quick return to normal” in the wake of the vaccines rollout, according to reports.

Government sources have told The Times that outdoor socialising and sports will be the first activities to get the green light from Boris Johnson after children return to school in March. 

Open-air markets and al-fresco dining are also expected to to be allowed to resume at around the same time, “but high-street shops and indoor dining will have to wait”, says the Daily Mail.

Should people who have had Covid be at the back of the vaccine queue?
A recent report from Public Health England showed that 83% of people who had had Covid were protected from reinfection five months later. 

Given that 3.7 million people in the UK have had Covid, asks Matt Webster of Anglia Ruskin University, should those with antibodies be at the back of the vaccine queue?

What the South African study means for the UK
Modified version of Oxford jab is in development
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

While it may be a setback for South Africa, the Oxford vaccine’s reduced effectiveness against that country’s dominant variant of Covid is not an immediate threat to the UK immunisation programme.

The South African strain remains rare here, with only 146 reported cases so far. 

But this time last year we had seen only four cases of coronavirus in total. Ministers will want to be sure that the new variant doesn’t follow the same trajectory as its predecessors.

What the South African study means for the UK
The rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to healthcare workers in South Africa has been paused after a new study raised doubts about the efficacy of the jab against the country’s most common form of the virus. 

Experts and ministers in the UK have been quick to point of the limited nature of the research and the limited spread of the South African variant here. 

Health Minister Edward Argar told the BBC’s Today programme this morning that just under 150 cases of the South African strain have been found in the UK, adding: “It’s still very much not the dominant strain.”

And with social media encouraging people to “reach the ‘correct’ take” on any given issue first, “you can see why people think fatalism is a good stance to pick”. But “hope is good for us”, and “pandemics do end”, she continues. “Whatever some people have taken to saying lately, better days are on the horizon.”

Will the Sturgeon-Salmond split sink the SNP?
Dispute ‘could bring down Scotland’s first minister’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Supporters of the SNP often accuse the English media of ignoring matters north of the border, but they may be grateful that relatively few column inches have been devoted to their party’s present strife.

The three-year dispute resolves around Nicola Sturgeon’s handling of sexual abuse allegations against her predecessor, Alex Salmond. Since his acquittal, the latter has hinted that he has information which will damage the woman who succeeded him as first minister.

separatist streak
Will the Sturgeon-Salmond split sink the SNP?
Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond have dominated Scottish politics for more than a decade, leading the campaign for independence during the 2014 referendum - and dealing with the fallout of their defeat.

But allegations of sexual harassment against Salmond have driven a wedge between the leading lights of the “out” campaign, with some suggesting that the dispute “could force Sturgeon to quit as first minister”, the BBC reports.

And while “the truth may never be excavated from beneath the rubble of civil war between nationalist factions”, writes The Guardian’s Rafael Behr, the divisions exposed in the independence movement could dent Sturgeon’s hopes of throwing off Westminster’s influence north of the border.

Vaccinations are continuing apace, infections are falling quickly and deaths aren’t far behind - and yet the ministerial mood music has rarely been more downbeat.

Since we’ll have to wait another fortnight until the government even talks about how lockdown might end, it’s worth casting an eye at Israel. British ministers have reportedly been following developments there closely...

While vaccine nationalism has left many countries at loggerheads during the Covid pandemic, relations between Israel and the UK appear to have been given a booster shot by the jabs rollout race.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been in regular contact with his Israeli counterpart, Yuli Edelstein, with the pair reportedly sharing tips to put in place speedy national immunisation campaigns.

And with a tentative lifting of Israel’s third lockdown now beginning, the allied nation’s plan may offer an insight into what to expect when Boris Johnson lay out the UK’s roadmap to normality later this month.

‘Humanity - all 7.8 billion of us - is on a collision course with the planet’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

“Let’s be honest: few government-commissioned reports make a real difference”, says Larry Elliott. What hope then, continues The Guardian’s economics editor, for Cambridge University academic Professor Partha Dasgupta’s report that “humanity – all 7.8 billion of us – is on a collision course with the planet”? The Covid pandemic has “illustrated the virtues of smart, activist states” who can stimulate real world change. “The need for change is glaringly obvious, and the opportunity is there too,” he adds. “That opportunity must not be squandered.”

Boris Johnson unveils ‘road to freedom’
PM reveals four-step plan to end England’s lockdown
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

After Boris Johnson last night laid out his plan for ending the UK’s third lockdown, the country now has its first tantalising glimpse of a return to normal.

Assuming the vaccine campaign continues at pace and hospitalisations are kept to manageable levels, 21 June will be the date on which all legal limits on social contact end.

The date will mark 455 days since the prime minister announced the first lockdown in March 2020, 14 months that have changed the country forever.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . PM unveils ‘road to freedom’
Boris Johnson last night said that his four-step plan to ease England’s lockdown is a “one-way road to freedom”. The prime minister promised spring and summer would be “incomparably better” as he paved the way for nightclubs to reopen, sports fans to fill stadiums and domestic tourism to return. He also revealed that “Covid status certificates” are being considered to help businesses reopen.

2 . Covid infections rise again
Britain recorded 10,641 Covid infections yesterday in the first week-on-week rise since the beginning of January. Official data shows that Covid cases were 9% up on last Monday, when 9,765 infections were reported. Boris Johnson yesterday told MPs that his plan to end lockdown is “cautious but irreversible”, adding that there is “no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain nor indeed a zero-Covid world”.

3 . Iran in uranium threat
Tehran has threatened to significantly increase its enrichment of uranium to 60% purity, almost enough to produce a dirty bomb. As tensions between Iran and the US continue to simmer, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said: “For nuclear propulsion or other works, we may enrich up to 60%.” Iran currently produces reactor-grade uranium enriched to no more than 5% purity. Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a deal ended by Donald Trump that constrains Iran’s enrichment programme.

4 . Trump loses tax battle
The US supreme court has declined to intervene to halt the turnover of Donald Trump’s tax records to a prosecutor in New York City. The court’s action was a victory for the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr, who has been seeking Trump’s tax records since 2019. The former president claimed that the legal battle was part of “the continuing political persecution of President Donald J. Trump”. His accountants must now turn over eight years of tax documents to investigators.

5 . Drug lord’s wife arrested in US
The wife of Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán has been arrested in the US on suspicion of drug trafficking. Emma Coronel Aispuro, who was detained at Washington Dulles International Airport, is charged with participating in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana. Guzmán, a former head of the international Sinaloa cartel, is serving a life sentence for drug trafficking and money laundering.

6 . Facebook restores Australian news
Facebook has said it will restore news content to its users down under after the social media giant last week blocked news appearing on feeds in response to proposed legislation that would make it pay publishers for content. The government says the proposed law would set up a “fairer” negotiation process between technology firms and news companies over the value of news content. Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Mark Zuckerberg had told him the ban would end “in the coming days”, adding: “Facebook has re-friended Australia.”

7 . Salmond slams ‘malicious’ plot
Alex Salmond has claimed there was a “malicious and concerted” attempt to remove him from public life following allegations of sexual harassment against him in 2018. In his submission to a Scottish parliamentary inquiry into the handling of the allegations against him, the former first minister also said that the husband and chief of staff of his former ally and successor, Nicola Sturgeon, are among those trying to take him down. Sturgeon has challenged Salmond to prove there was a conspiracy against him, saying he has made claims “without a shred of evidence”.

8 . Biden marks Covid milestone
Joe Biden yesterday urged the country to unite in its battle against Covid-19 as the nation’s death toll from the virus passed 500,000. “I ask all Americans to remember those we lost and those we left behind,” the president said. “But as we all remember, I also ask us to act, to remain vigilant, to stay socially distanced, to mask up, get vaccinated when it’s your turn.” More than 28.1 million Americans have so far been infected - another global record.

9 . Furlough ‘to continue till May’
Boris Johnson has signalled that the furlough scheme will continue beyond next month as he pledged not to “pull the rug out” while lockdown restrictions are being eased. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to extend the support scheme until at least May, with sources suggesting that furlough support will be gradually wound down after that month. Meanwhile, trade unions are demanding that the furlough scheme be extended until the end of the year.

10 . Uber ‘deterring drivers’ on cash
Lawyers have accused Uber of trying to deter drivers from seeking compensation for missed holiday and minimum wage payments after last week’s court ruling. The taxi-hailing app may have to pay out more than £100m after the UK Supreme Court ruled that drivers must be classified as workers. However, it has written to drivers claiming “this judgment does not apply to drivers who earn on the app today”. Lawyers acting for the drivers believe they are due about £12,000 in compensation each, which would cost Uber more than £26m.

Today’s newspapers
‘The wait escape’
“The wait escape” is The Sun’s headline after Boris Johnson’s last night revealed his cautious plan to end the UK’s third lockdown. Metro says the prime minister has announced that 21 June is the “day life goes back to normal”, while the Daily Mirror says that the milestones along the way will be the “best days of our lives”.

Amid the celebrations, The Guardian reports that the PM also warned that lifting lockdown will “inevitably result in more cases, hospitalisations and deaths”. The Daily Mail, meanwhile, wonders why “it’s going to take months” for the restrictions to be eased given falling infection rates.

In other news, the Daily Star devotes part of its splash to the claim that flared trousers are coming back into fashion. “Haven’t we suffered enough?”, the paper asks.

Flu cases drop to zero as lockdown cuts infection
But experts fear epidemic next winter
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

While social distancing and vaccines are steadily driving down Covid cases - today the seven-day average of new cases fell below 10,000 for the first time in five months - their effect on flu has been even more dramatic.

Yet it seems that every silver lining has a dark cloud. Health officials are expecting an unusually virulent flu season next year - on top of the negative health effects of battling the pandemic.

Flu cases drop to zero as lockdown cuts infection
Not a single case of influenza have been recorded in England for the past seven weeks - but the country may pay for the lull with more severe outbreaks next winter, scientists are warning. 

Public Health England flu expert Dr Vanessa Saliba told The Independent that the current record-low flu infection rates are “likely due to changes in our behaviour, such as social distancing, face coverings and hand washing, as well as the reduction in international travel” during the Covid-19 pandemic.

She also credited increased uptake in the flu vaccine, saying this season’s immunisation programme is on track to be “the most successful ever”.But experts fear drop in immunity may pave way for major influenza epidemic next winter

With Covid-19 dominating the news cycle, you would be forgiven for forgetting that other diseases still exist.

‘The grotesque sight of Labour united with right-wing Tory rebels’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

“If the rumours are correct and we end up with the grotesque sight of Labour whipped into voting alongside right-wing Tory rebels to defeat a meagre corporation tax rise that would only affect those who’ve done well out of the pandemic, then I fear for the future,” says Ian Lavery on HuffPost. Our country “depends on Labour to argue for, and point the way to, a better future,” he argues. And this future “must be built on a partnership with society, paid for by taxation – not a partnership with business, paid for by society”.

Millions of Brits living in ‘Covid free’ areas
Hundreds of neighbourhoods recorded close to zero cases last week
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

After data yesterday revealed that one vaccine dose cuts the risk of hospitalisation among high-risk groups by more than 80%, this morning brings more good news.

Over seven million people in the UK are living in areas that reported fewer than three new Covid cases last week.

The dramatic drop in infections offers a glimpse into the impact of the vaccine campaign, as well as boosting hopes that Boris Johnson’s roadmap out of lockdown is on track.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . Millions live in ‘Covid free’ areas
More than seven million people in the UK are living in areas where cases of Covid-19 have become negligible, according to The Telegraph. Analysis of official data has found that hundreds of neighbourhoods across the country recorded close to zero cases last week. The areas include large parts of Cornwall, Devon and Wiltshire. Others in London include Notting Hill West, while Trafford in Manchester also recorded almost no new infections.

2 . Sunak to boost culture and sport
Rishi Sunak is expected to announce more than £400m of additional support for the badly-hit culture sector in tomorrow’s Spring Budget. The chancellor will hand out £408m to help museums, theatres and galleries in England reopen once Covid restrictions start to ease. Sunak is also planning a £300m sports recovery package, with a “significant chunk” allocated to cricket.

3 . Genocide warning in Ethiopia
The ousted leader of Ethiopia’s Tigray region has accused the federal government and its Eritrean allies of genocide. Speaking to CNN, the President of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front Debretsion Gebremichael called for an independent probe into the alleged killings, rape and violence. He said US President Joe Biden must ramp up the pressure against “invader forces”.

4 . Johnson accused of secret fund
Boris Johnson has been accused of secretly trying to set up a charity to pay for a makeover of his Downing Street flat by his fiancée, Carrie Symonds. The Daily Mail reports that the scheme is based on the presidential charity used by the White House to raise millions of dollars for interior design, antiques and art. The US version is bankrolled by private donors and Johnson’s proposed version would be funded by wealthy Tory backers. A No. 10 spokesperson said: “Matters concerning works on the Downing Street estate, including the residences, are covered in the Cabinet Office annual report and accounts.”

5 . Nigerian girls released
A group of girls who were abducted from a boarding school in Nigeria have been released and are “safe”, according to reports. Armed men shouting slogans including “Allahu akbar” and “God is great” abducted 317 students from the Girls Science Secondary School in Zamfara state on Friday. Sky News says that several large groups of armed men operate in the region and are known to kidnap for money and for the release of their members from jail. The government has repeatedly denied paying ransoms for the return of the girls.

6 . US warned of fourth Covid wave
The spread of coronavirus variants could cause a “fourth surge of cases” in the US, a health official has warned. Around 70,000 new cases a day were recorded last week, with nearly 2,000 deaths a day in the same period. “Please hear me clearly: at this level of cases, with variants spreading, we stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we have gained,” said Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

7 . Prince Philip moves hospital
The Duke of Edinburgh was yesterday transferred to St Bartholomew’s Hospital for continued treatment. Prince Philip, 99, had already spent 13 nights at another London hospital and is being treated for an infection. Doctors will also carry out testing and observation for a pre-existing heart condition. Buckingham Palace said Prince Philip is responding to treatment and “remains comfortable”.

8 . Sarkozy to appeal sentence
Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president of France, has been sentenced to three years in jail, two of them suspended, after a high-profile corruption investigation. Sarkozy was convicted of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 by suggesting he could secure a plush job for him in return for information about a separate case. The 66-year-old’s lawyer says he will appeal the sentence and Sarkozy will remain free during that process.

9 . Jabs cut hospital risk by 80%
A single shot of the Oxford-AstraZeneca or the Pfizer-BioNTech jab reduces the chance of needing hospital treatment by more than 80%, the BBC reports. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the daily press briefing yesterday that the latest vaccine results were “very strong”, adding that data on falling infections is “seriously encouraging”. Government scientists hailed the results, but added that two doses were still needed for the best protection.

10 . Phone addiction impacts sleep
Almost 40% of university students are so addicted to their smartphones that they suffer from bad sleep, according to new research. A study of 1,043 students aged 18 to 30 at King’s College London found that 406 had symptoms of smartphone addiction and more than two-thirds of the addicts had trouble sleeping, compared with 57.1% of those who were not addicted to their device. The youngest participants in the study were the most likely to show signs of addiction.

Today’s newspapers
‘Prayers for Philip’
The Daily Mirror this morning calls for “Prayers for Philip” after the Duke of Edinburgh was moved to a specialist hospital for tests on a pre-existing heart condition. Prince Philip, 99, is now at London’s St Bartholomew’s and is also battling an infection.

The Daily Mail splashes on allegations that Boris Johnson is secretly trying to set up a charity to help pay for a costly makeover of his Downing Street flat. The paper says the scheme could cause claims of a “conflict of interest” if it is bankrolled by Tory donors.

And the Financial Times says Chancellor Rishi Sunak will use tomorrow’s budget to launch new rules aimed at helping the City of London attract fast-growing companies to compete with financial centres including New York, Amsterdam and Frankfurt.

Has the US ever had Covid under control?
Scientists warn of ‘fourth surge of cases’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

On paper, the US has been hit less hard by Covid than the worst-affected countries in Europe - including the UK - where death rates have been higher. 

But the ebb and flow of the pandemic has been quite different. Whereas we have had two distinct waves of infections followed by a sharp drop, the US has had a rolling series of shallow peaks and troughs as outbreaks move from state to state. And in the past week, case numbers have been rising rather than falling.

fourth wave fear
Has the US ever had Covid under control?
During the early days of the pandemic, the response from Donald Trump’s White House was focused more on shutting down any sense of panic than locking down to avoid infections.

Trump repeatedly suggested that the virus was “going to disappear”, a prediction that unsurprisingly did not materialise before he was ejected from office in last year’s election.

Under Joe Biden, the publication of a 200-page Covid-19 strategy document in late January suggested a change of management style. But with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warning of the threats of new variants, it remains to be seen whether the new president can wrest control of the coronavirus.

‘Chancellors are not just accountants - they have the power to reshape the country’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

1. Rishi Sunak’s love of the Star Wars films is well documented, but “it is not yet clear what kind of new world order the Treasury crusader wants to create”, writes Rachael Sylvester in The Times. As Sunak prepares to unveil his budget tomorrow, the unanswered question of his “long-term political mission” looms ever larger. Because after all, “chancellors are not just accountants; they have the power to reshape the country”, says Sylvester. Describing a dinner party where she was seated next to him, she recalls that “we started talking about knife crime - my teenage son had just been mugged at knifepoint - and I realised I had no idea where he stood on law and order”.

Why the Irish border is back on the agenda
EU threatens legal action over UK plan to delay parts of Brexit deal
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Having got Brexit done in the nick of time, the British government now seems to be trying to undo at least one bit if it - with the inadvertent assistance of the EU.

It was the European side that broke first, briefly suspending the Northern Ireland Protocol when it feared that Covid vaccines might be exported across the Irish border. Now the UK says it won’t be ready to bring in the stricter rules required from the end of this month.

While the Irish government has called for pragmatism, the EU is sticking to the letter of the law - and Boris Johnson seems less keen on a deal he hailed as a triumph just a couple of months ago.

Why the Irish border is back on the agenda
Just two months after the signing of a Brexit trade deal, the issue of the Irish border has re-emerged as a serious sticking point between the UK and EU.

Brussels has warned that it will launch legal action “very soon” after the UK government on Wednesday announced that it would delay the implementation of parts of the Brexit deal to allow businesses in Northern Ireland time to adapt.

Cabinet Office minister David Frost said that the UK would extend “grace periods” to ease trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. However, the plan provoked a “furious response” in Brussels, The Guardian reports.

INSTANT OPINION
‘Brexit allows us to be immigration liberals’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

1. “Not so long ago, immigration was the issue that troubled Brits the most,” writes James Forsyth in The Times. But today, just 2 per cent of voters say it is the country’s most pressing issue. Maybe it’s the “Covid effect” or perhaps “the end of free movement and the resumption of border control has taken much of the heat out of the issue”, he says. But the country’s dramatic shift in attitude can be seen in the “remarkably uncontroversial” policy towards offering visas to Hong Kongers following China’s National Security Law. “Something has changed utterly” and it is now up to Boris Johnson to deliver a “more sensible policy, to make this a country that seeks out talent from around the world”.

Dear Varkeychan,

The traditional royal response to any kind of unwelcome reporting, however trivial or lurid, was never to complain and never to explain.

Last week’s leak of bullying allegations made against the Duchess of Sussex two years ago suggests “The Firm” is planning a more proactive approach - although it remains to be seen what form it will take.

What next for the royals after ‘racism’ allegations?
The Royal Family is facing an unprecedented PR disaster as racism allegations made by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle threaten to tarnish the Crown’s reputation across the world.

In an interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired in the US last night, the couple claimed that a member of the family raised “concerns” about “how dark” the colour of their son Archie’s skin would be when he was born. 

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex declined to name the family member. But the allegations of racism within “The Firm” are dominating headlines and reportedly sent shockwaves through Buckingham Palace.

‘Equality seemed simple, so we underestimated how revolutionary such changes would be’

Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

On International Women’s Day, we “look back in anger - but with pride, too”, writes Polly Toynbee in The Guardian. The passing of the Equal Pay and Sex Discrimination Acts in the 70s did not represent “liberation won”, but one step towards changing cultural norms. “Equality seemed simple, so we underestimated how revolutionary such changes would be,” Toynbee writes. Today, women still face widespread discrimination at work or in the home, and the pandemic has affected women particularly badly. So, “Are we nearly there yet? No, but we’ve come quite a way. That, at least, signals hope.”

Media rejects Prince Harry racism claim
Couple criticised for attacking press without supporting evidence
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s war with the British press looks set to rumble on after the airing of their tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey on ITV last night.

After the Duke said press “racism” was behind the pair’s decision to leave the UK, the Society of Editors said tabloid media is “not bigoted and will not be swayed from its vital role holding the rich and powerful to account”.

The Sussex’s request for privacy, it seems, may not be forthcoming just yet.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . Media reject Prince Harry racism claim
The Society of Editors has denied the media is racist after Prince Harry said racism from within the tabloid press was a “large part” of why he and Meghan Markle left the UK. In the couple’s tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey, broadcast on ITV last night, the Duke alleged that the tabloid media in the UK is “bigoted” and creates a “toxic environment”. However, the media freedom organisation criticised the couple for accusing the press of racism without “any supporting evidence”.

2 . Report declares Xinjiang ‘genocide’
China’s actions in Xinjiang have violated every single provision in the United Nations’ Genocide Convention, according to an independent report by dozens of global experts. The report, published by the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy think tank, alleges that the Chinese government “bears state responsibility for an on-going genocide against the Uyghur in breach of the (UN) Genocide Convention”. The report was put together by a host of global figures in human rights, war crimes and international law. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said allegations of a genocide “couldn’t be more preposterous”.

3 . UK economy changed forever
The economy will never fully return to its pre-pandemic pattern even as life slowly returns to normal, according to the governor of the Bank of England. Andrew Bailey said that shifts in spending and working patterns seen over the past 12 months would prove permanent. He continued that the structural economic changes during the crisis will not end, but “my best guess is that we will see some persistence, not full persistence but not a full reversion to pre-Covid either”.

4 . Biden offers Taliban power-share
Joe Biden has offered the Taliban a return to power in Afghanistan as he seeks to bring the longest war in American history to an end. The White House is ready to offer the Islamic fundamentalists a power-sharing deal with the Afghan government if they agree to lay down their arms. The offer comes almost two decades after the US invasion that “routed the Taliban regime and triggered a bloody insurgency that has killed tens of thousands of people”, The Times says.

5 . UK could have fourth wave
England’s deputy chief medical adviser has warned that it is too soon to rule out a fourth wave of Covid-19. Jenny Harries told the daily press briefing that under current levels of infection, “a new wave could easily take off again”. Her call for caution came as Boris Johnson admitted that with the re-opening of schools “there will be a risk of increased transmission” that could delay the end of lockdown. The UK yesterday reported less than 100 deaths for the second day in a row, the first time that has happened since 9 October.

6 . Brazil’s Lula cleared in court
Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been cleared of corruption by a Supreme Court judge. Lula was freed in 2019 after 18 months in jail following a major bribery scandal involving politicians and business leaders. The development paves the way for the 75-year-old to make a run for the presidency in 2022. However, the current president, Jair Bolsonaro, has accused the Supreme Court judge of bias. The annulment was celebrated by leftist figures, including Argentinian President Alberto Fernandez who said the convictions were “issued with the sole purpose of persecution and eliminating him from politics”.

7 . Call for action on conversions
Campaigners have warned that ministers are not moving quickly enough to ban LGBT+ “conversion therapy”. Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch insisted that the government is “committed” to “ending” the practice and takes the issue “very seriously”. But equality campaigners said targeted action is required. Conversion therapy refers to any form of treatment or psychotherapy that aims to change a person’s sexual orientation, “ranging from electric shock treatment to religious teaching and discussion”, the BBC reports.

8 . Nightingales to close
The NHS has announced that the emergency Nightingale hospitals set up to cope with a surge of Covid-19 cases are to close from April. Seven Nightingale hospitals were built in England, beginning in April 2020 with the 4,000-bed facility at London’s ExCel centre. Birmingham, Bristol, Belfast, Cardiff, Exeter, Sunderland, Harrogate, Glasgow and Manchester also had their own temporary hospitals. The sites in London and Sunderland will stay open for vaccinations.

9 . Loophole closed on sex abuse
Sports coaches and priests who have sex with 16- and 17-year-olds in their care are to face prosecution after the government closes a contentious legal loophole. A new law will prevent adults in positions of trust from engaging in sexual relationships with young people under 18. It will bring sports coaches and religious leaders into line with the legislation currently in place for teachers and doctors.

10 . Ex-soldier killed fiancée
An inquest has heard that a former soldier, who was granted bail after threatening his fiancée with a gun, killed her in a frenzied attack just weeks later. Terence Papworth, who served in Afghanistan, used a vodka bottle and ornamental sword in the “sustained” attack on Amy-Leanne Stringfellow. Doncaster Coroner’s Court heard a post-mortem examination found 58 different injuries. Papworth was found dead in Leeds Prison in November.

‘Worst royal crisis in 85 years’
Prince Harry and Meghan Markles’s interview with Oprah Winfrey dominates the front pages for a second day this morning. The Daily Mirror leads the drama, saying that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s “bombshell” tell-all has sparked the “worst royal crisis in 85 years”.

The Daily Mail says Buckingham Palace is “paralysed” with “horror and dismay” over the interview. The front page headline asks of the couple: “What have they done?”

“Just the Four of Us Now” is Metro’s more serene headline, above a portrait of the couple with their son, Archie, taken after their interview with Winfrey.

Dear Varkeychan,

While most British newspapers have either sided with the remaining royals - or else reserved judgement - the international press has come out decisively for Team Harry and Meghan.

But the biggest beneficiary, most commentators agree, will be the queen of the television interview, Oprah Winfrey herself.

How the world responded to Harry and Meghan
Headlines across the globe are being dominated by allegations of racism within the Royal Family following the broadcast of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey.

As “The Firm” considers its next move - with the Queen reportedly vetoing a prepared statement last night - the world’s media are filling the vacuum left by their silence over what The Times’ Carol Midgley describes as a “televised napalm raid” on the Palace.

The “hysterical” reaction of “Britain's notorious tabloid press” is especially hard to miss, with “wall-to-wall coverage” from commentators who are “apoplectic with rage” after the interview aired on ITV on Monday, says The Hollywood Reporter.

‘You can’t calm the tabloid sharks by throwing steaks at them’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

Yesterday’s airing of Oprah Winfrey’s interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle prompted a “news meltdown” among the UK press, writes Hugo Rifkind in The Times. It was an unsurprising reaction given that “royalty is Britain’s oldest soap opera”. And while it is hard not to sympathise with the “daily, grinding attention” to which Markle was subjected, it is puzzling that the royal couple saw this interview as “the way out”. “You don’t calm the sharks by throwing steaks at them”, he adds. The Royal media machine will “never calm down”, and the couple’s interview fed its “insatiable” appetite.

Brazil’s Covid ‘atom bomb’ could go worldwide
Brazil’s largest cities are facing the collapse of their health systems, experts have warned, after the country yesterday reported 1,972 Covid deaths - a new daily record.

Fiocruz, Brazil’s health institute, has warned that more than 80% of intensive care beds are occupied in 25 of the country’s 27 state capitals, amid fears that “the highly contagious variant in Brazil may have knock-on effects in the region and beyond”, the BBC reports.

“Brazil is a threat to humanity”, Fiocruz epidemiologist Jesem Orellana told the Agence France-Presse news agency. “The best we can do is hope for the miracle of mass vaccination or a radical change in the management of the pandemic.”

Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

1. “Whether you consider the duchess is a victim of racism or believe that she is a difficult individual living a life of luxury who craves attention, she is not alone in her predicament,” writes Daniel Finkelstein in The Times. The problem for the Royal Family is that “the truth is that what has happened to the duchess has happened before”, most famously to Princess Diana. Therefore Prince Charles must examine what has “repeatedly” happened, and use the ongoing scandal as an “opportunity for modernisation”. “It is now his defining challenge.”

The suspected murder of Sarah Everard has the potential to be one of those rare but terrible events that casts a light on broader, deeper ills.

It has certainly added a sense of urgency to the government’s Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy - a long-term project that has evidently not yet delivered on its promise.

UK ‘violence against women’ strategy explained
A nationwide vigil highlighting women’s safety issues is being organised following the disappearance of Sarah Everard in south London last week.

After as-yet unidentified human remains were found yesterday in a wood in Kent, the “Reclaim These Streets” organisers said the event was “for Sarah, but also for all women who feel unsafe, who go missing from our streets and who face violence every day”.

The 33-year-old’s disappearance has renewed debate about the endemic abuse as the government prepares its latest “violence against women and girls” strategy.

Yesterday, women on social media “shared their rage at the brazenness of the violence” towards missing 33-year-old Sarah Everard, writes Alona Ferber in the New Statesman. “They shared their chosen methods of protecting themselves against attack” and they told of the “mundane, ever-present possibility of violence that looms over women’s lives”. Newspapers reported that police in Clapham, south London, had warned women to be careful going out alone. “As if women need reminding to be careful,” Ferber says.

Met faces inquiry into Everard case
Watchdog will consider response to prior allegation against suspect
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Reports that the police officer suspected of killing Sarah Everard had been accused of indecent exposure a few days before she disappeared will bring fresh heartache for her family - and pile institutional pressure on the Met.

Already accused of failing to act on crimes against women, the force will now have to answer the claim that a more proactive response could have saved Everard’s life.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . Met faces inquiry into Everard case
Scotland Yard’s handling of an indecent exposure allegation against the officer suspected of murdering Sarah Everard will be investigated by the police watchdog. The Independent Office for Police Conduct will consider whether Metropolitan Police officers “responded appropriately” to the alleged incident, just days before the marketing executive disappeared. Everard, 33, was last seen in Clapham, south London, on 3 March.

2 . Wales to relax lockdown
The “stay at home” order in Wales will be lifted and replaced by a “stay local” message this weekend. From Saturday, four people from two households will be able to meet outdoors to socialise, including in gardens. In other changes, outdoor sports facilities will be able to reopen and indoor care home visits will restart for single designated visitors.

3 . Biden eyes Covid ‘independence’
Joe Biden said he hopes that America can “mark independence” from Covid on 4 July if people get vaccinated. The US president said he would order states to make all adults eligible for vaccinations by 1 May. Biden, who had set a target of administering 100 million vaccinations by his 100th day in office, said yesterday this target would be reached on day 60.

4 . Zaghari-Ratcliffe ‘suffers from PTSD’
The British-Iranian woman held in Iran since 2016 needs urgent treatment for her mental health, according to a charity which says she is suffering from serious depression and PTSD. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces a new court hearing in Tehran this weekend, after her ankle tag was removed. The report was commissioned by the human rights charity Redress and sent to the British government.

5 . Nurses may get 2% rise
Nurses’ pay could increase by more than 2% under government plans to defuse mounting controversy, according to The Times. A government source said it was a matter of “when, not if” the current 1% offer is increased, adding that ministers are considering a rise of more than the 2.1% proposed by the NHS. The source also suggested that a rise of between 2% and 3% would be “realistic”.

6 . PM under pressure on women’s safety
Boris Johnson is under pressure to take action to tackle male violence and make the UK safer for women in the wake of the disappearance of Sarah Everard. During the annual International Women’s Day debate in the House of Commons, female MPs told stories of the harassment they had faced and called for tougher action from the government when the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill returns to the House of Commons.

7 . William says royals not racist
Prince William denied he belonged to a “racist family” yesterday as he publicly addressed claims made by his brother and the Duchess of Sussex. He became the first royal to reject the allegations when he told reporters: “We’re very much not a racist family.” Asked if he had spoken to Harry he replied: “No, I haven’t spoken to him yet but I will do.”

8 . New questions over Hancock ‘crony’
A private WhatsApp exchange shows that the former neighbour of Matt Hancock who is supplying the NHS with millions of Covid test tubes joked to the health secretary that he had “never heard of him”. The Guardian says the exchange suggests Alex Bourne, a former publican who had no experience of producing medical devices before he began supplying the government, may have downplayed his relationship with Hancock in public.

9 . Royal Mail set for Sunday deliveries
In response to the Covid pandemic and the resulting boom in online shopping, Royal Mail is to trial Sunday parcel deliveries for big retailers. A spokesman said: “The last year has reset so many customer expectations.” Rivals such as DPD and Hermes already make Sunday deliveries for retailers such as Amazon.

10 . PM to rule out Scots poll
Boris Johnson will insist that he will not grant a second Scottish independence referendum, even if the SNP wins a majority in May’s elections. Ahead of the prime minister’s speech to the Scottish Conservative Party conference, a government source said: “We’re not having a referendum in the middle of a pandemic”. The Telegraph says Whitehall is increasingly focusing on how to counter the prospect of “Scexit” - Scottish exit from the Union.

Today’s newspapers
‘Did cops fail to act?’
The Sun leads on news that the serving Metropolitan Police officer arrested on suspicion of the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard also stands accused of a separate allegation of indecent exposure. It says he “flashed” four days before the disappearance of the 33-year-old and asks: “Did cops fail to act?”

The Guardian reports that the former neighbour of Matt Hancock who is supplying the NHS with millions of Covid test tubes joked to the health secretary that he had “never heard of him” during a private WhatsApp exchange.

"William blasts back at race slur" is the Daily Mail's splash this morning as it leads on Prince William’s insistence that the Royal Family is not racist in the aftermath of allegations during Prince Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah Winfrey.

PM under fire after government orders fresh public inquiry into new mine

The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

A few weeks ago on The Week Unwrapped podcast, we talked about the government’s apparent willingness to approve Britain’s first new deep coal mine in a generation.

Now that decision seems to have been reversed, to the delight of environmental campaigners - and the dismay of some local Conservative MPs.

MPs accuse PM of pandering to ‘climate terrorists’
Boris Johnson is facing a rebellion from Conservative MPs in the North after bowing to pressure to halt plans to build a coal mine in Cumbria.

Environmental groups are celebrating after Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick last night ordered a fresh public inquiry into the controversial project, effectively blocking the construction of the deep coal mining site.

But the decision sparked a flood of angry messages on WhatsApp groups of Tory MPs, who “have pounded Downing Street with furious complaints about the U-turn”, says The Sun.

‘Johnson is an uneasy advocate for his government’s new approach’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

1. Chancellor Rishi Sunak may have imposed unpopular measures on the road to repairing the country’s finances post-pandemic, but “it’s far from clear whether the prime minister shares his appetite for that”, writes Stephen Bush in The i. Having “floundered” when facing questions from Keir Starmer on a pay rise for nurses, “the government is now signalling that a U-turn may be in the works”. Sunak’s budget is taking the government in a new direction, but the prime minister has suggested this week that he “is an at best uneasy advocate for the government’s new approach and way of doing things”.

Dear Varkeychan,

The answer to the question in our headline appears to be no, but anyone who has heard the prime minister expressing full confidence in their position is bound to feel a bit precarious.

Nevertheless, many of the people unhappy with how the police handled Saturday night’s vigil want Cressida Dick to stay on and work out how to avoid the same thing happening again.

vigil fallout
Are Cressida Dick’s days at the Met numbered?
The recent history of the Metropolitan Police is strewn with complaints about overzealous policing of protests. From Black Lives Matter demonstrations to Extinction Rebellion shutdowns, the force has come under intense scrutiny over its approach to such gatherings.  

But rarely has the condemnation of the Met been as united as in the fallout from Saturday’s heavy-handed response to the vigil on Clapham Common for Sarah Everard, the murdered 33-year-old marketing executive.

The blame has fallen on Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, who hit out at “armchair critics” of officers making “really difficult calls”. The controversy is not the first in Dick’s career, leading to suggestions that the powerful images from the event may make it her last.

Why has the Oxford vaccine faced so much scrutiny?
European doubts persist despite positive UK data
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Right from the start, the Oxford vaccine led to questions as well as celebrations. The university had less experience designing clinical trials than Pfizer, Moderna and other big drugs companies, and its results were less clear-cut.

That (along with a large dose of politics) may help to explain some of Europe’s reluctance to use it, despite rising case numbers across the continent - and overwhelming evidence that the vaccine is safe and highly effective.

TODAY’S BIG QUESTION
Why has the Oxford jab faced so much scrutiny?
Even the most ardent supporter of the government would struggle to deny that the UK’s pandemic response has had its fair share of low points. But in one regard the country has streaked ahead of its neighbours: vaccinations.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is the jewel in the crown of the jab rollout that has so far seen over 24 million people receive at least one dose, with plans in place to ramp up to five million jabs every seven days in the coming weeks.

But despite the positive data emerging from the UK, the Oxford University-developed jab has repeatedly faced criticism and suspicion from European nations.

A total of around 2.4 million doses were administered each week in England in February. But according to The Times, at the start of this month, local health bosses were told by NHS England “to prepare to vaccinate twice as many people each week from mid-March ‘for several weeks’”.

‘What good would it do to replace Cressida Dick?’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

1. “To all those – from Left and Right – joining in the clamour for Cressida Dick to resign as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, a pertinent question hangs in the air”, writes Patrick O’Flynn in The Spectator. “Who would you hire to replace her and what good do you think it would do?” London policing must answer to “two sharply diverging audiences: the local one and the national one”, says O’Flynn, adding that “it is an impossible job on the cutting edge of the culture war”. Dick manages to “somehow pull it off to a largely acceptable degree”, talking the jargon but committed to “strong policing” on the ground. The Met Commissioner is “a wolf in sheep’s clothing”, he adds.

‘The biggest foreign policy shift since the Cold War’
Report calls for new relationships with key foreign powers
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Foreign policy has, understandably, taken a back seat for the past year - but even before the pandemic talk of Britain’s place in the world tended to start and stop at Brexit.

Now the government is looking beyond our closest neighbours. The goal, it says, is an approach that’s both ethical and profitable - a tricky balancing act at the best of times (which these may not be).

‘The biggest foreign policy shift since the Cold War’
As the UK struggles to carve out a post-Brexit place in the world, Boris Johnson has laid out his vision for Britain’s defence and foreign policy.

Titled Global Britain in a Competitive Age, the 100-page government report is the “most radical reassessment of Britain’s place in the world since the end of the Cold War”, says The Times.

A key conclusion is that Britain must expand its influence in the Indo-Pacific region, which is described as being “increasingly the geopolitical centre of the world”.

Why the UK is facing a vaccine shortage
NHS bosses urged to stop booking jab appointments
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

‘Underpromise and overdeliver’ was the mantra we all got used to hearing in the first few weeks of the vaccination campaign. 

The problem is that we became so accustomed to overdelivery that merely meeting targets, which still looks likely, will feel like a bit of a letdown. This afternoon we look at what might have led to the change of pace.

Why the UK is facing a vaccine shortage
Just days ago, the government was preparing to ramp up the UK’s vaccination campaign to five million jabs every week. But now health bosses are being warned of an impending shortage of doses.

The NHS has said there will be a month-long “significant reduction” in weekly vaccine supply from the end of March. This means that, contrary to recent expectations, no one under the age of 50 in England will receive a first jab until May.

The news follows a threat by the EU to block vaccine exports to countries with high inoculation rates, including the UK.

‘The Tories have abandoned London’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

1. “If you are a Tory voter in London, tough luck,” writes Allister Heath in The Telegraph. “You now live in a one party city-state, controlled forever more by… Labour.” One in three Londoners voted Tory at the general election, which is “low but hardly trivial”. So why have the Tories “given up” on the mayoral election? “Many Tories believe that they must be seen to be anti-London, with losing the capital a cheap investment to grab votes elsewhere”, Heath suggests. “But in abandoning Londoners to long-term decline, while simultaneously and mindlessly embracing Left-wing urbanism, it is betraying not just its electorate but also the country’s long-term interests.”

‘Census will reveal how Covid transformed the UK’
Survey expected to lay bare the impact of lockdown
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

There is something fittingly biblical about carrying out a census at the end of a plague year.

Not everyone is in favour of conducting the once-a-decade survey at such an unusual time, but our guest expert, Oxford professor Danny Dorling, argues that we should embrace the opportunity to step back and decide how to prepare for what comes next.

expert’s view
‘Census will reveal how Covid transformed the UK’
Many people may feel unsure as to whether the English, Welsh and Northern Irish census of 2021 should be going ahead, given that it’s occurring during a pandemic when many aspects of our lives are far from normal. The census has actually been postponed by a year in Scotland due to these concerns.

Census timing has appeared unfortunate before. The 2001 census took place during the peak of the foot and mouth disease outbreak, amid concerns that census officials might spread the disease between farms.

Because most people will fill in their 2021 census form online, disease transmission is less of a concern this year. But there’s another criticism levelled at censuses: that they only ever deliver a snapshot of a population at a specific time, no matter how unusual or temporary the circumstances within a household may be.

But the Daily Mail says Downing Street has entered into “secret talks” with officials in Delhi in the hope of a swift resolution.

1. “When Boris Johnson recruited Dominic Cummings, he was warned that it would end in disaster,” writes Fraser Nelson in The Telegraph. Despite Cummings once being dubbed a “career psychopath”, No. 10 has seen “none of the vengeance that his enemies predicted”. In any case, “it’s not quite clear why the prime minister’s allies should be so worried about embarrassing disclosures”. Even if we learn that Johnson was distracted by “personal dramas” while co-ordinating the pandemic response, “when he won his majority, his complicated personal life was incredibly well-documented”.

Will the UK-EU vaccine war delay lockdown lifting?
Ban on export of Covid jabs to Britain threatens to slow campaign to inoculate population

The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Europe is starting to see the lingering side effects of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine fallout.

While Boris Johnson is apparently trying to temper threats of an export ban to the UK to avoid any delays in lifting lockdown, the recent decision by some EU countries to pause their AstraZeneca rollout appears to have caused a collapse in confidence in the jab - an adverse reaction that might prove hard to shake off.

Fresh threats
Will the UK-EU vaccine war delay lockdown lifting?
Health experts breathed a sigh of relief after the EU and UK avoided a vaccine war earlier this year when the bloc backed down on plans to restrict Covid jab exports.

But now hostilities have flared up again in the wake of a fresh threat to block doses bound for Britain while Brussels struggles to meet the EU’s shortfall.

Boris Johnson is expected to speak to his European counterparts this week in an effort to avoid further clashes that could threaten the UK’s speedy vaccination campaign.

1. “A new poll by YouGov of 8,000 people across seven European countries shows more people now consider the AZ jab unsafe than safe,” writes Patrick O’Flynn in The Telegraph. “A less arrogant political elite might detect that now would be a good time to crawl away in shame”, but the EU Commission is “doing just the opposite”. Why has the EU engaged in an “illogical” tussle over the exports of AstraZeneca vaccines? “The answer, I fear, is that this is now the only way in which the European Commission can demonstrate an advantage of EU membership to those still in the club,” O’Flynn says. “That advantage is that a country can avoid being beaten-up.”

Lockdown anniversary: good things that came out of a terrible year
Breakthroughs in vaccine science among much-needed silver linings of Covid pandemic
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The country fell silent today on the one-year anniversary of the first lockdown and paid tribute to those who have died from Covid-19.

It has been described as the “toughest year in living memory”, testing the limits of people’s physical and mental health, as well as the stability of their finances. The Week has searched high and low to find some positives to take away from an exceptionally difficult year.

Lockdown anniversary
Good things that came out of a terrible year
Exactly a year ago today, Boris Johnson gave a televised address to warn of the “biggest threat this country has faced for decades”.

Since then, everyday life in both the UK and worldwide has changed drastically as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, with populations ordered to stay at home during lockdowns that have kept friends and families apart and triggered widespread job losses. Despite the tough restrictions, the coronavirus has claimed more than 2.7 million lives across the globe, including more than 126,000 in Britain.

But as the rollout of Covid vaccines provides light at the end of the tunnel, here we reflect on some of the other much-needed glimmers of hope that have emerged amid the devastation of the past 12 months.

‘Boris Johnson has transformed from libertarian buccaneer to lockdown bureaucrat’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

1. “Boris Johnson’s whole political identity has always been as an optimistic, fun-loving, freedom-seeking libertarian”, writes Rachel Sylvester in The Times. Yet the pandemic has seen Johnson introduce “the greatest curtailment of liberties the country has ever known”. His “transformation from libertarian buccaneer to lockdown bureaucrat has infuriated the Tory right-wingers”, but “this does not bother Johnson”. “The public is overwhelmingly supportive of the lockdown restrictions and impressed by the vaccine rollout”, Sylvester says. And “these are the people on whom the prime minister believes his electoral success depends”.

The threat posed by spread of new coronavirus variants in Europe
Fresh lockdown measures imposed across continent as mutant Covid strains cause spike in infections
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Parliament is about to break up for Easter recess, and the prime minister appears to have been partaking in some end-of-term japes.

His comments about “capitalism” and “greed” fuelling the UK’s successful vaccine rollout were downplayed by his colleagues as “banter”, but he faced a scolding from critics. One area they want him to take seriously is the threat of new coronavirus variants in Europe.

The threat posed by spread of new coronavirus variants in Europe
Angela Merkel is warning that Germany has been plunged into a “new pandemic” as coronavirus variants spreading across the country trigger a rapid rise in infections.

The German chancellor has joined a host of other European leaders in announcing an extension of lockdown measures as the continent struggles to contain new Covid strains.

France has introduced a partial lockdown on 16 regions, including the greater Paris area, while Italy has tightened restrictions until at least Easter, amid a stumbling continent-wide vaccination rollout that threatens to undermine the UK’s successful jab campaign.

1. “We have given up a great deal in the past year, and some will rightly point out that many have given up their lives. But above all we have sacrificed that sense of proportion that we once possessed,” says Philip Johnston in The Daily Telegraph. Concerns over the impact of lockdowns on the younger generation have been “borne out” and culture has changed “perhaps irrevocably”, he continues. Enough people are now “so inured to the sense of security offered by lockdowns that they will accept them in other circumstances”.

Subject: Nazara’s 22-year survival journey to $80 million gaming IPO

Varkeychan, your 2-min introduction to today’s story from The Ken
Good Morning Varkeychan,
 
Before you continue reading, I'd recommend putting aside any food or beverage you may be consuming. Because today, I'm going to talk about cockroaches.
 
Hear me out.
 
They're known for being dirty and extremely revolting. You wouldn't want them anywhere near you. But despite the universal disgust directed towards them, cockroaches have survived on this planet for nearly 300 million years.
 
They survived the giant asteroid that took out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. They survived numerous natural and man-made disasters. Legend has it that they were even seen crawling through the rubble after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II. Rest assured, they'll be here long after we humans wipe each other out. They might even take over the planet.
 
Why am I talking about cockroaches? Because Arundhati's story today is about a 22-year-old company that has shown similar survival skills. Nazara Technologies, a gaming firm, survived the 2000 dotcom crash and the entry of Reliance Jio in 2016, which killed mobile value-added services as a business.
 
It witnessed the launch and eventual demise of scores of other gaming platforms over two decades. But Nazara lived to tell the tale. It beat the odds via multiple pivots. After starting out by offering casual online games like Housie, then selling bulk SMS packs, and then mobile-based games, Nazara took a call in 2015 to become a holding company. It acquired gaming and esports companies, sports media platforms, and even an early-learning app.
 
Today, Nazara is on the verge of fetching around $80 million through an IPO later this month. Its IPO issue was oversubscribed 175.5 times last week. Analysts expect a market capitalisation of over $800 million after the listing.
 
How did all this happen? That's Arundhati's story today. It's a free read, so do share it widely: https://the-ken.com/story/nazaras-journey-to-80-million-gaming-ipo/ (10-minute read)
 
PS: Did you know that cockroaches can survive without their heads for a week? It beats me why we thought of Spider-Man and Ant-Man, but never Cockroach-Man.
 
Best,
Jaideep

The pros and cons of compulsory vaccination
MPs and publicans furious after PM endorses ‘vaccine passports’ for pubs
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Getting ID’d at the pub became a whole lot more controversial this week as the PM suggested pub-goers might have to prove they are vaccinated to get through the door.

It prompted fury from some of his own backbenchers, publicans and civil liberties activists, who said it was a move towards compulsory vaccination. Boris Johnson conceded that there are “moral complexities”. The Week has explored a few of these in this afternoon’s top briefing.

Pros and cons of compulsory vaccination
Boris Johnson’s suggestion that pubs may require customers to show a vaccine certificate has left MPs and landlords outraged.

“It may be down to individual publicans” to decide whether to require proof that their customers are Covid-free, he told MPs yesterday.

The Guardian says the comments were “a far stronger endorsement of the widespread use of Covid certification than has previously been made by the prime minister”.

EU vaccine export talks: is the UK being targeted?
EU leaders are holding virtual talks today to discuss how to boost Covid vaccine supplies across the bloc, including new measures that could affect supply to the UK.

The European Commission proposed controversial new rules on Wednesday that would allow the EU to severely curtail the export of vaccines to places such as the UK and the US for up to six weeks. These are “countries that are either receiving EU-made vaccines but not sending other shots back, or that have vaccinated more of their population than the EU”, said Politico Europe.

‘The EU vaccine rollout has been so bad that lives have been lost’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “The European Union’s vaccine debacle is a cautionary tale about the perils of risk aversion”, writes Bruno Waterfield in The Times. “What’s clear is that the EU is unable to assess risk rationally and is too bureaucratically rigid to respond to fast-moving events.” The bloc’s inability to roll out the jab quickly has “been so bad that it is certain lives have been lost” as a “risk-averse institution managed to focus on entirely the wrong risks”. The EU’s vaccine campaign also has “big implications for the future of Britain’s post-Brexit relationship with the EU”, he adds. After all, “given the events of the last two months, would Britain want to align itself with the EU’s political culture of risk aversion”?

PM issues warning as lockdown eased
Two households in England can now meet outside
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The return of the legal right to meet up to five other people outdoors in England will coincide with a few days of unseasonably warm weather, with temperatures set to reach 23C in some places.

It will be a welcome step forward for many, even if it comes with a prime ministerial instruction to maintain social distancing. For now, the joys of spring cannot be unconfined.

daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . PM issues warning as lockdown eased
Two households or groups of up to six people are now permitted to meet outside again as the stay-at-home order in England comes to an end. Outdoor sport facilities including tennis courts and golf courses are also reopening, and weddings are allowed again. On the eve of the change in rules, Boris Johnson warned that “everyone must continue to stick to the rules, remember hands, face, space, and come forward for a vaccine when called”.

2 . School abuse ‘next national scandal’
Police say that sexual harassment and assault claims made by school pupils may be the “next child abuse scandal that engulfs the nation”. After thousands of allegations were posted on the website Everyone’s Invited, a police helpline is to be set up to report incidents. The website has now received testimonies from children as young as nine. Most pointed the finger at other pupils.

3 . Suez ship ‘refloated’
A vast container ship that has been wedged in the Suez Canal since Tuesday has been refloated, according to reports. Footage on social media appeared to show that the stern of the Ever Given had been moved towards the canal bank, opening space in the channel. The 400m (1,312ft) long vessel became jammed diagonally across a southern section of the canal in high winds. The canal, which runs through Egypt, is one of the world’s busiest trade routes.

4 . Floyd murder trial to begin
The trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin starts today, ten months after the death of George Floyd. Key evidence in the hearing will be the video of Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes during his arrest in May last year. Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to the three charges against him - second and third degree murder and second degree manslaughter.

5 . Small firms suffer from Brexit
Small businesses have suffered a marked drop in exports to the EU, according to the Federation of Small Businesses. It said 35 of the 132 exporters it surveyed had temporarily suspended trade with the EU or stopped it permanently. UK exports to the EU fell by 41% in January, according to government figures. “It’s a nightmare,” said Sharon da Costa, the managing director of Fighting Films, a Bristol-based producer of judo movies.

6 . Report to suggest ‘scrapping BAME’
The term BAME should no longer be used by public bodies and companies, the government’s disparities commission will recommend this week. A report by the independent Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities is expected to say BAME has become “unhelpful and redundant”. The label is an acronym for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic. The report will also include research suggesting that the term “ethnic minority” is more popular with people from ethnic minorities than “BAME”.

7 . Girl critical after police chase
The Met has launched an investigation after a teenage girl was left in a critical condition after a car being chased by police crashed into a lamppost. On Sunday morning officers indicated for a car to stop near Streatham Common, but when it failed to do so, a chase began which ended when the car crashed into a lamppost on Greyhound Lane. Five women in the vehicle were taken to hospital.

8 . Jab checks ‘last straw’ for pubs
A vaccine passport scheme could be “the last straw” for hundreds of struggling pubs, Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin has claimed. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, he says that pubs are “hanging on for dear life” and have been “devastated by G-force changes of direction”. He adds that the passports proposal would force reluctant bar staff on to the front line of the Covid battle for civil liberties.

9 . Slough to become ‘sponge city’
Selected roads in Slough are to benefit from the flood defence of permeable surfaces that soak up surface water. Pioneered in China, the “sponge city” project involves turning a proportion of urban land into features that absorb rain and flood water. Environment minister Rebecca Pow said the move will help “reinforce the UK's position as a world leader in innovation and new technology”.

10 . Brisbane locks down on seven cases
The Australian city of Brisbane will go into another three-day lockdown to contain a Covid outbreak that has grown to seven cases. The Queensland state capital - home to more than two million residents, has suffered very few locally acquired cases since Australia’s first wave of the virus a year ago. In January, the city shut down for three days due to a single case.

Meanwhile, The Daily Telegraph reports that a racial disparities commission is due to tell the prime minister that the term BAME - black, Asian and minority ethnic - should no longer be used by public organisations and companies.

How the #MeToo movement in UK schools began
Major investigation launched after outpouring of sexual harassment allegations in schools

Dear Varkeychan,

Children are leaving school believing that sexual harassment is part of growing up, Maria Miller, former women’s minister, warned today.

The ever-growing number of testimonials on the website Everyone’s Invited certainly gives that impression, with police calling it the next national scandal.

Thousands of pupils have reported abuse - lessons no child should ever have to learn.

'National scandal'
How the #MeToo movement in UK schools began
Whitehall has launched a major investigation into the emerging “rape culture” scandal in UK schools.

Officials from the Home Office, Department for Education and Department of Health are working with senior police officers and Ofsted to look at the huge number of allegations, which one police chief has called the education sector’s “MeToo” moment.

It was a website called Everyone’s Invited that “started a revolution in our schools”, says the Evening Standard. It was set up last year by Soma Sara, 22, a sex abuse survivor, for past and present pupils to report claims of sexual harassment.

1. Nearly a year after he was elected, Keir Starmer “shows little sign that he can adapt to politics after the pandemic”, writes Stephen Bush in The Times. The coronavirus crisis has made it impossible for him to get on the front foot. He was “well placed to give off the tones of reassurance and constructive opposition” over the past year, but “now that politics is beginning to return to normal, he lacks the skillset to do so himself”. Bush concludes: “He will remain on the back foot because he lacks the vision to be on the front.”

Boris Johnson says roadmap on course
Shops, pubs and restaurants set to reopen in a fortnight
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Boris Johnson has told the public to use their new-found freedom “to play sport, to take exercise, to have fun and build our national resilience”.

The prime minister added that data suggests the next stage of lifting lockdown, scheduled for 12 April, should go ahead as planned.

However, he rejected calls to speed up the process, warning that we do not know “how strong our fortifications now are [or] how robust our defences are against another wave”.

daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . PM says roadmap on course
Boris Johnson has said England is on course for the reopening of shops, pubs and restaurants in a fortnight. The prime minister said he had not seen anything in the latest coronavirus data “that would cause us to deviate from the roadmap”. However, he also warned the while the public should go out and “have fun” as lockdown restrictions are eased, they should still abide by the rules and “remain humble in the face of nature”.

2 . Suez open as vessel freed
Traffic has resumed in the Suez Canal after the container ship blocking it was freed by salvage crews. Tug boats honked their horns in celebration as the 400m-long (1,300ft) Ever Given was dislodged with the help of dredgers. The Guardian says insurers, the shipping industry and the thousands of businesses reliant on container goods are “still counting the cost of the accident”.

3 . Floyd murder trial begins
A witness has said that George Floyd was “slowly fading away” during the nine minutes that Derek Chauvin kneeled on his back and neck in May last year. In their opening statement, Chauvin’s lawyer argued his use of force was “unattractive but necessary”, adding that the evidence “is far greater than nine minutes and 29 seconds” of video footage. The BBC reports that the trial is being seen by many as a “pivotal moment in US race relations”.

4 . Bezos orders fightback
Jeff Bezos has complained that company officials are not aggressive enough in how they react to criticisms of the internet giant, Vox reports. The Amazon CEO’s call to be more active in refuting allegations comes as the Amazon News Twitter account and executive Dave Clark recently began lashing out at critics online. The Guardian describes Bezos’ new confrontational stance as a “Trumpian move”. The web giant is currently facing the largest union election in its history at a warehouse in Alabama.

5 . WHO reports on Covid origin
A World Health Organization (WHO) draft report has found that Covid-19 probably emerged through human contact with an animal, and likely started spreading no more than a month or two before it was noticed in December 2019. Other WHO theories over its origin include transmission from frozen or chilled food, or, in a less likely scenario, an accidental laboratory release. The WHO identified tracking the origins of Covid-19 as a “priority research area” back in February 2020, but “has been quick to temper expectations” about how quickly the project will be concluded, The Telegraph says.

6 . New charges for Maxwell
Court papers show that Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite accused of aiding in her former partner Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse, faces two additional charges. An indictment identified a new accuser, referred to as “minor victim-4” in court papers, and expanded the timeframe of Maxwell’s alleged participation in Epstein’s abuse by seven years – from 1994 to 2004. Maxwell now faces a total of eight counts, including four related to the years between 1994 and 1997, when prosecutors say she helped Epstein groom girls. The other two are allegations of perjury in 2016.

7 . Brits in France lose licences
British citizens living in France have been left without a valid driving licence, or face losing theirs within months, because of the failure of the two nations’ governments to sign a post-Brexit agreement. “Commuters risk losing their jobs, tradespeople can’t work [and] elderly people have missed medical appointments”, Kim Cranstoun, who moved permanently to France three years ago, told The Guardian. Government sources insist a UK-France reciprocity agreement is “close to being sealed”.

8 . Brazilian minister stands down
An ultraconservative foreign minister in Brazil has resigned after diplomats and lawmakers accused him of damaging the nation’s reputation and putting lives at risk by wrecking relations with China. Ernesto Araújo, a 53-year-old career diplomat and close ally of President Jair Bolsonaro, became notorious for his criticism of Xi Jinping’s China, while pouring praise on former US president Donald Trump. “One thing’s for sure, he’s the worst foreign minister Brazil has ever had,” said Celso Amorim, a predecessor of Araújo.

9 . PM calls for global pandemic plan
Boris Johnson has joined more than 20 world leaders to call for a new global settlement to help the world prepare for future pandemics. Global leaders, including Emmanuel Macron of France and Germany’s Angela Merkel, said another pandemic or health crisis is a matter of “not if, but when”, adding that the current crisis has shown that “nobody is safe until everyone is safe”.

10 . Angry gardener ‘drowned cat’
A court has heard that a gardener drowned his neighbour’s cat because it kept digging up his vegetable plot. Richard Giles, 69, drowned the tabby cat, named Ruby, after becoming angry with her for “ruining” his patch of carrots and leeks. Weymouth Magistrates’ Court was told he drowned the cat in a water butt. Giles has admitted the offence, which carries a maximum sentence of up to six months in prison.

‘What are we waiting for?’
“What are we waiting for?” asks the Daily Mail’s splash this morning as Boris Johnson faces mounting calls to lift lockdown faster. The Times reports that the prime minister believes there is nothing in the most recent data “that would cause us to deviate from the roadmap” for ending the third national shutdown.

Johnson has joined other world leaders, including Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, in calling for a global settlement similar to that formed after World War Two to protect from future pandemics. Writing in The Telegraph, they say the virus has been a “stark and painful reminder that nobody is safe until everyone is safe”.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mirror says the prime minister is facing an investigation over claims he gave US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri special treatment during his time as mayor of London. Arcuri this week confirmed suspicions that she and Johnson had a four year affair.

George Floyd: the challenges faced by prosecutors in the trial of Derek Chauvin
Failure to secure main conviction could see other accused officers walk free

Dear Varkeychan,

The trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin continues this afternoon, a day after jurors heard opening arguments and witness testimony on the killing of George Floyd.

One witness was a 911 dispatcher who said officers pinned Floyd down for so long she thought her security video feed had frozen.

Despite the footage, prosecutors face a number of challenges in what has become a crucial juncture for America’s race relations.

The challenges for prosecutors in the Derek Chauvin trial
Derek Chauvin’s use of force against George Floyd was “unattractive but necessary”, lawyers for the former Minnesota police officer have argued at the opening of his murder trial.

Defence lawyer Eric Nelson told the jury yesterday that “the evidence is far greater than nine minutes and 29 seconds” of video footage showing Floyd’s death during his arrest last May by police including Chauvin, who denies all of the charges against him.

As demonstrators rallied outside the Minneapolis court, the first prosecution witness later testified that Floyd was “slowly fading away” as Chauvin kneeled on his neck. “His eyes slowly rolled to the back of his head” until “he didn’t have no life in him no more”, the witness said.

‘Even Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen would blush at Johnson’s new press room’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “Big day in Downing Street,” writes Henry Deedes in the Daily Mail. Not because of yesterday’s “soft-soap” lockdown easing, but “the grand unveiling of Boris Johnson’s new White House-style press room, built for such a costly sum (£2.6 million) the wallpaper may well have been woven from the thread produced by caviar-fed silkworms”, Deedes writes. “First thoughts on the decor? Bright. Very bright”. Even “Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen might have blushed at the brilliant blue lustre used as background”. Its oak panelling “reminded me of Judge Rinder’s daytime TV set. Or was it more Premier Inn?”, he wonders. Either way, “the setting may have been new but otherwise much of what the PM had to say was painfully familiar”.

Is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine safe?
Germany becomes latest country to partially halt use of the jab
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Germany initially banned the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for over-65s over doubts about its efficacy in older people, before changing its mind. It then paused the jab’s rollout over fears about rare blood clots, before restarting the campaign when EU regulators said it was safe and effective. Now it is advising against the use of the jab for under-60s over fresh fears about clotting.

Europe seesaws
Is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine safe?
The German government has suspended routine use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for anyone under the age of 60, amid fresh concerns over blood clots.

People aged 59 and under are still be allowed to receive the Covid shot, but only “at the discretion of doctors and after individual risk analysis”, according to internal documents seen by German news agency DPA.

The move is the latest in a series of blows to the team behind the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has faced increasing scrutiny in the past few months.

Taliban declares victory against US in Afghanistan
When the US began dropping bombs on Afghanistan in October 2001, a conflict was triggered that would stretch beyond two decades and claim the lives of 2,300 US troops and more than 43,000 civilians.

As the US and Northern Alliance Forces took the capital Kabul, the Taliban - which had ruled Afghanistan since 1996 - called for a negotiated settlement to end the conflict. Then US president George W. Bush responded: “There’s nothing to negotiate.”

‘The SNP’s plans promise speculative benefits while ignoring real trade-offs’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “The Scottish National Party is a latecomer to the pro-European cause,” writes Oliver Kamm in The Times, having “recommended leaving the Community in the 1975 referendum now it has the zeal of a convert”. However, “the SNP’s plans, like the Brexit campaign itself, promise speculative benefits while ignoring real trade-offs”. Were Scotland to rejoin, “it would enjoy some gains from being part of its internal market but at the price of erecting trade barriers to the rest of the UK”, Kamm says, while “the concessions previously enjoyed by the UK within the EU, such as the budget rebate and opting out of the euro, would probably not be on offer.” If Scotland plans to pursue a strategy of getting their feet back under the table in Brussels, they will have to recognise that “EU governments want Britain back but not at any price”.

Powerful studying program for Beginners and Intermediate levels. All common mistakes analyzed.
Hello everyone. Today I want to write a post about a program for learning data structures and algorithms. I heard this question about studying a program a lot and wanted to create a styling program for beginners and intermediate levels. Also, I saw many mistakes which my friends, and coders and I made and by analyzing all of such mistakes I wanted to write and construct the correct program. In the beginning, I created this program for myself, I tested it and it helped me to learn data structures and algorithms just within 6 months. Within these 6 months I learned and mastered the following topics: Linked List Stack Queue Binary Search Tree Hash Table and Map Sorting algorithms Searching algorithms Greedy Algorithms Dynamic Programming basics Graph BFS and DFS I am now continuing to learn by the program which I created and it helps me to learn topics faster, efficiently and on a long-term basis. I can solve the problems which I solved and similar problems in a fast way. So let's dive into the program which I created for myself and you. First of all, let me analyze all the common mistakes which coders continue to make. 1. UNDERESTIMATE TIME COMPLEXITY FINDING I always see the coders who underestimate and do not study time complexities. What do you think will be the result of not knowing the time complexities? Yes, the probability that you will have Time Limit Exceeded is very high. I strongly advise firstly to learn time complexities. Before even writing your code you should be able to analyze its time complexity. You may ask how? For example, if you are going to use for the inside of other for then the time complexity of your program will be O(n^2), if you are going to use map inside for then your time complexity will probably be O(nlogn), if you are going to use bubble sort then your time complexity will be O(n^2). Tips before writing a code: Look for the input range. Is it small or too big? Calculate in such a way: 10^9 operations will take around 1 second so try to make the number of operations which your code will run under 10^9. Try to think of all possible data structures you can apply and analyze time complexity. If you have an option between using for inside other for and hash table inside one for then the time complexity of the first solution will be O(n^2) and of the second option will be O(n). It is obvious that it is better to use a hash table to make less time complexity. Have strong knowledge of time complexities. Resources for learning time complexities: MIT 6.001 course, Understanding Program Efficiency Part 1 and Part 2 on YouTube MIT 6.006 course on YouTube Abdul Bari Algorithms on YouTube All of these resources helped me to master time complexity finding. They show deep analysis in finding different time complexities. 2. DO NOT SPEND TIME FOR LEARNING THEORY You always should have a knowledge and understanding of the data structure or algorithm which you are going to use. You should know the working principle of different data structures and algorithms. For example in which cases it is better to use insertion sort rather than quicksort, how stack and queue work, or when it is useful to apply hash table for solving problems. For example, a stack can be used for counting parentheses and reversing a string, hash table for fast find the value by key, for fast access in other words, etc. I promise you to deeply learn theory but do not spend too much time on it. Best resources for learning theory: MIT Algorithms on YouTube Jenny's Lectures on YouTube Abdul Bari Algorithms on YouTube Mycodeschool on YouTube 3. NOT REVISING AND DOING A LOT OF PROCRASTINATION I always heard that people cannot or spend too much time for solving problems which they solved already. Some are not sure that they can solve the problem which they already solved. That is a huge problem and I think that the possible reasons are: Not revising Not enough learning a theory Procrastinating by studying one day and having a rest for several days. I think that programming is like a sport. For example, to succeed in the sport you will always need to train, repeat your training program, again and again, add some new training methods and exercises, and never give up. The main thing is discipline. You always should revise the topics by solving several problems for them to not forget them and master them. You should apply the knowledge and techniques which you learned by studying the theory immediately to problem-solving. Learn theory and immediately go to practice. Think that theory is your personal trainer and you are the athlete who is going to practice that again and again while you do not master it. Tips for learning for the long term: Revising all topics, even two times a week Solve some problems and revise your solved problems every week Write contests Learn theory and have a strong foundation Do something each day You may ask why I mentioned writing contests? The answer is that competition will give you additional motivation for learning. You will see your level and will want to have a better rating and will you will begin training by studying and practising. Also try to solve at least one problem each day for 21 days, after 21 days you will automatically have a habit to go and solve problems. Do not procrastinate. NEVER DO THAT! If you will procrastinate for 3 days you will have a habit to continue doing that and as a result, the work that you already did will have no meaning, you will just lose your time. Discipline and hard work are the keys to success. Now let's consider the topics which you need to learn and how. Let's discuss the program. Program: 1. Time complexities Learn mainly Big-O notation and analyzing the time complexity of the program which you wrote Practice by considering tests and some quizzes from the internet Advised time to spend: 1 week 2. Recursion Learn how the recursion works Try to write some basic problems by recursion and solve LeetCode problems for recursion Advised time to spend: 1 week 3.

What a third wave of Covid might mean for the UK
Scientists warn that ‘baseline measures’ will still be needed after lockdown is fully lifted
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Boris Johnson’s confirmation that shops, hairdressers and outdoor hospitality will reopen next Monday has been somewhat dampened by scientific modelling showing the risks of a third wave of coronavirus later in the year.

Reports that the UK medicines regulator is investigating the AstraZeneca vaccine, and the growing opposition to Covid passports, might also spoil the PM’s spirits. At least he can drown his sorrows in a real-life pub garden next week.

‘Grim assessment’
What a third wave of Covid might mean for the UK
The lockdown easing steps planned for May and June risk unleashing a third wave of coronavirus as deadly as that which hit the UK over winter, government scientists have warned.

The newly published predictions from the outbreak modelling subgroup of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) put a dampener on Boris Johnson’s announcement last night that England’s roadmap out of the Covid-19 lockdown was on track.

The prime minister confirmed that hairdressers, gyms and non-essential shops, as well as outdoor areas of pubs and restaurants, can reopen as planned from 12 April.

INSTANT OPINION
‘Vaccine passports are heading from unthinkable to unstoppable’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “The biggest question facing Boris Johnson is the future of his so-called vaccine passports,” writes Fraser Nelson in The Spectator. “A few months ago, the idea was dismissed by No. 10 as ‘discriminatory’.” But fast-forward to now and, “without debate or democratic scrutiny, vaccine passports are quickly heading from unthinkable to unstoppable”. The conclusion of the government’s first lockdown review, published this weekend, “primarily looks at vaccine passports and international travel”, Nelson continues. “It clearly says that vaccine identity cards could be demanded ‘in hospitality settings’ - in other words, in pubs.” And that means that “contrary to what some of the weekend papers had been briefed, a passport for the pub is a live idea”.

‘Still safe’
Under-30s to be offered alternative to AstraZeneca
The UK medicines regulator has said people under 30 should be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine due to concerns about rare and unusual blood clotting.

As a precautionary measure, people aged 18 to 29 should be given the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine instead, said the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

The regulator said there was not yet proof that the jab had caused the clots, but that evidence of such a link was “firming up”. It stressed that the cases were extremely rare and, for most age groups, the benefits of getting vaccinated outweigh the risks.

The 6 May vote in the constituency of Hartlepool in County Durham was triggered by the resignation of Labour MP Mike Hill, who is due to face an employment tribunal later this year into claims of sexual harassment and victimisation.

Red Wall sees Starmer as ‘Mr Man-on-the-fence’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “No politician can be anything other than themselves for long. They just look phoney, pointless, dull or too obviously calculating,” writes Daniel Finkelstein for The Times. This, he says, is a lesson Keir Starmer “would do well to reflect upon”. Starmer “is a successful liberal lawyer”, “a southerner, a graduate and a London MP who lives in his constituency”, says Finkelstein, and these are “all good qualities”. But he has become “a leader who’s afraid of being himself and wishing to be seen as someone else”, he writes. Starmer “desperately wants to be the voice of the red wall seats for whom he is not the authentic voice”, says Finkelstein. “And voters can see it.” Focus groups “call him ‘Mr Man-on-the-fence’ and say that he only jumps off the fence to climb on to a passing bandwagon”.

The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

There are plenty of statistics doing the rounds today to show why the benefits of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine still far outweigh the risks for the vast majority of adults.

But it was a surprising human voice that cut through the numbers and offered a boost in confidence for the jab. The sister of Neil Astles, the first named Briton to die from a blood clot on the brain after having the AstraZeneca vaccine, said her “much loved” brother was “extraordinarily unlucky” and was firm that people should still “go ahead and have the vaccine”.

Weighing up
The AstraZeneca blood clot risk in context
Confidence in the UK’s Covid vaccination programme risks being undermined by news that under-30s will be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab as a result of blood clot concerns, experts have warned.

Government scientists and ministers are expected to “embark on a media blitz” to persuade the public that the vaccine is still safe following the announcement by regulators, The Times reports. And media outlets have also been putting the risk into context.

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) issued a statement yesterday about “extremely rare” cases of blood clots combined with low platelet counts in a small number of people who had the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. No such cases have been reported in recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, the independent advisory body said.

Battered and bloodied but unbowed after losing its Middle Eastern caliphate, the Islamic State is targeting another region of the world to establish a jihadist battleground.

Following the US killing of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and “stinging defeats in Syria and Iraq”, the Islamists have “found a new lifeline in Africa”, The New York Times (NYT) reports. Isis “has forged alliances with local militant groups in symbiotic relationships that have pumped up their profiles, fund-raising and recruitment”, says the paper - triggering a deadly rise in Islamist violence on the continent.

‘I’ve already had my first Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. I’ll certainly be getting my second’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “If you were told you had a one-in-a-million chance of winning the lottery, you’d think it couldn’t be you,” writes Cathy Newman in The Independent. “So, logically, if you’re told you’ve got a one-in-a-million chance of dying from a blood clot after having the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid jab, you’d also think it was pretty unlikely.” While “health disasters cast a long shadow”, “good sense is required from the public, too” in response to the news about the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. “It would be a tragedy if Britain’s brilliant vaccine rollout was scuppered by a crisis in confidence,” Newman continues, adding that as an asthma sufferer and the journalist who broke the story: “I’ve already had my first Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. I’ll certainly be getting my second.”

The questions David Cameron needs to answer
Government announces review into the Greensill scandal
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

When David Cameron predicted in 2010 that lobbying was the “next big scandal waiting to happen”, it is unlikely he foresaw himself at the centre of the fallout.

Eleven years on, he insists he has not broken any rules in his work for Greensill. However, his conduct has raised questions about the adequacy of laws brought in by his own coalition to tackle - in the words of the former PM - “the far-too-cosy relationship between politics, government, business and money”.

Breaking silence
The questions David Cameron needs to answer
No 10 has announced an investigation that will look into David Cameron’s lobbying on behalf of Greensill Capital. Lawyer Nigel Boardman will lead the independent review of the now-collapsed finance firm’s activities in government.

The news comes after the former prime minister issued a public statement last night for the first time since he was accused of lobbying the government using personal messages to the chancellor on behalf of the financial services firm before it went bust.

Although he has been cleared of breaking lobbying rules or codes of conduct, his critics say there are still questions that remain unanswered.

Call for clarity over rules as pubs reopen in snow

To be considered as such, any shelters, marquees or other structures need to have at least half of their walls “open at all times” while in use, according to government rules. The guidance is reportedly based on legislation linked to the indoor smoking ban that defined what constituted being outdoors.

EXPERT’S VIEW
Why the marriage of Prince Philip and the Queen was ‘last of its kind’
In November 1947, a dynastic union was forged between the royal houses of Greece and Great Britain. It would be one of the last of this kind of royal marriages in history - a type of union that had knitted together the continent for 1,000 years.

When Philip, prince of Greece and Denmark married Elizabeth, princess of Great Britain, they reconnected two bloodlines descended from Queen Victoria. But they also renewed a kinship tie between Britain and Denmark that had been joined together numerous times, from Canute and Aelfgifu in 1015 to Edward VII and Alexandra in 1863.

‘Thousands of children in care are at risk due to Brexit’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “Three years on, the individual tales of Windrush injustice still have the power to catch my breath,” writes Sonia Sodha in The Guardian. But not only has the government declined to fix the “hostile environment” for migrants to the UK, but it is also now “putting thousands more children in care at risk of this fate as a consequence of Brexit”. The deadline is fast approaching for EU citizens living in the UK to apply for the right to remain. “Local authorities have to do this for children in care,” notes Sodha. “But the Children’s Society has established through Freedom of Information requests that, so far, fewer than 40% of the 3,700 or so eligible children in care and care leavers we know about have applications in,” she writes. “The government was warned again and again about the consequences of its policies for the Windrush generation, to no avail. Will they listen this time?”

Life starts again
How the world reported the UK’s lockdown easing
While much of the world remains under lockdown, the UK yesterday offered a tantalising glimpse of a return to normality as pubs and hospitality venues reopened after almost four months of Covid restrictions.

“Chilly weather” failed to deter Brits who “flocked to shed shaggy locks and browse for clothes, books and other ‘non-essential’ items”, as shops, gyms and hairdressers also welcomed back customers, says The Washington Post.

“Long lines formed outside some stores”, the paper continues, and restaurants and pubs reported a “flood of bookings” as people across England planned “outdoor meals and drinks, despite unseasonably cold weather that brought springtime snow flurries to many areas”.

The unrest in Belfast “is a problem that’s not going away”, says Katy Balls in the i newspaper. “Instead, the UK Government’s Union problems are mounting on all fronts.” Just as there is no single cause behind the violence in Northern Ireland, there is “no single solution” and “unease is also building on other parts of the Union strategy”. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon “appears to be making a comeback”, which could lead to another push for independence, says Balls. “As the Union comes under even more pressure in the coming weeks and months, the UK Government will have no choice but to find a way to fight back against separatism. [Boris] Johnson is going to have a job on his hands simply keeping the Union together.”

Keir Starmer joked in PMQs today that the Line of Duty’s anti-corruption team AC-12 should be brought in to probe allegations of “sleaze” in the Conservative party.

If the Labour leader is right that Greensill is just “the tip of the iceberg”, a wider investigation into lobbying across Whitehall would have even Ted Hastings sighing “Mother of God”.

The line-up
Who’s who in the Greensill scandal
The Conservatives were accused of tolerating a “sleazy culture” today as they were ordered to vote down a parliamentary inquiry into the Greensill Capital lobbying fallout.

Labour has been pushing for a broader inquiry into lobbying than the one set out by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as a senior civil servant became embroiled in the row.

“If there was greater transparency... I think things would be very different. I don’t think you would have this sort-of sleazy culture being allowed to develop. That’s why we need tougher rules,” shadow cabinet minister Rachel Reeves told Times Radio. Here are the most high-profile people involved.

‘The assumptions of postwar politics are crumbling’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. The death of Prince Philip is a reminder we are “coming to the end of the postwar era and are entering the post-postwar world”, writes Daniel Finkelstein in The Times. “The assumptions of postwar politics are crumbling,” he says. As a description, “postwar” denoted the world order and was synonymous with modernity, but these are “no longer universal assumptions”, writes Finkelstein. “In particular they are not the assumptions of new generations of voters.” There are examples of this, “big and small”. Firstly, “American power” and the country’s “status as a success story that demanded emulation” is “much more widely questioned”. As the Cold War recedes in memory too, those “wishing to associate capitalism with prosperity and freedom” are no longer able to “rely on the immediate postwar experience of communism to make the argument for them”, says the writer. “All these changes mean that it no longer makes sense to talk with ease about our era as postwar,” he adds. “Maybe we need a new term. Post-Covid?”

US allies fear ‘retaliatory attacks’ after Joe Biden sets Afghanistan withdrawal date
Troops to leave on 11 September, prompting Taliban to declare victory

The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Now Joe Biden has set 11 September as the date for US troops to leave Afghanistan, attention has turned to what kind of legacy will be left behind.

With the Taliban proclaiming they have won the conflict and many Afghans fearing civil war, one US veteran writing in The New York Times this week finds the overriding question he asks himself is: “Was it worth it?”

US allies fear ‘retaliatory attacks’ after Joe Biden sets Afghanistan withdrawal date
US allies fear that Joe Biden’s decision to renege on Donald Trump’s date for withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan could lead to a wave of Taliban attacks on Nato military and diplomatic personnel.

In a speech yesterday, Biden said that it was “time to end America’s longest war”, announcing that US troops would “come home” on 11 September 2021, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.

A meeting of the North Atlantic Council at Nato’s Brussels headquarters saw a “tense” discussion of Biden’s plans, Politico reports, with some allies voicing concerns over “retaliatory attacks”, as well as fears that it is “too early for an orderly withdrawal of troops”.

‘Was Afghanistan worth it?’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. Timothy Kudo, a former Marine captain who served in the Afghanistan war, recalls a letter he wrote on the eve of his deployment in case he was killed. “The first paragraph reads, ‘It was worth it’, then it continues about honor, duty and patriotism before closing with a final farewell and a request for burial at Arlington,” he writes in The New York Times. “‘It was worth it’. The words reverberate. The weight feels a little heavier, and I whisper them like a mantra and continue marching. But now the war is ending, and those words are enigmatic.” As the US pulls its troops out of Afghanistan, Kudo fears that “the most meaningful part of my life – and only its prologue – is being erased by time, by the enemy and even by my country”. He wonders: “Was it worth it? Everything has been because I’d been able to answer yes to that question. But what if the answer is no?”

Breakaway football clubs join European league
Six English clubs among breakaway dozen
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

After a year of upheaval, the creation of a new European football tournament might seem like small beer - but the intervention of prime ministers and presidents across the continent suggests otherwise.

At stake, according to all those who oppose the new league - which seems to be everyone not in it - is the soul of the sport. The breakaway clubs would enjoy great riches, but those left behind would struggle to compete.

daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . Breakaway clubs join European league
Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham have come under fire after agreeing to join a new European Super League - a “seismic move”, says the BBC. The Premier League clubs will join AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid in the new competition. Boris Johnson, Fifa, Uefa and the Premier League have all condemned the move, along with several fans’ organisations which say it is motivated by greed.

2 . Poverty causes crime, says top cop
A police chief has stated that tackling poverty and inequality is the best way to reduce crime. In an interview to mark his retirement as chief constable of Merseyside police, Andy Cooke said that if he was given £5bn to cut crime, he would put £1bn into law enforcement and £4bn into tackling poverty. “The best crime prevention is increased opportunity and reduced poverty,” he said. “That’s the best way to reduce crime.”

3 . Patel criticises Facebook encryption
Priti Patel says Facebook is “blinding” itself to the issue of child abuse by adopting new security measures that will make it more difficult to catch paedophiles. Demanding that tech giants “take the safety of children as seriously as they do the business of selling advertising, phones and online games”, the home secretary will call for Facebook to rethink plans for all messaging on its platforms to be “end-to-end” encrypted.

4 . Floyd trial verdict due
Protests have broken out across the US as Americans wait for a verdict in the trial of the white police officer charged with murdering George Floyd last year. With closing arguments expected in Derek Chauvin’s trial today, tensions are growing in several cities. The most serious charge the former officer is facing is second-degree murder, but The Guardian says the jury might choose to find him guilty on third-degree murder or manslaughter, or acquit him altogether.

5 . Harry and William ‘spoke at Windsor’
Prince Harry and Prince William reunited for two hours after the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral, according to reports. The Sun says the brothers joined Prince Charles for the first time since Harry and wife Meghan’s interview with Oprah Winfrey “threatened to tear the family apart”. Charles held private talks with his warring sons after the Windsor Castle ceremony, raising hopes that their rift can be healed.

6 . Deaths in Egypt train crash
At least 11 people have been killed and 98 injured when a train derailed near the city of Toukh, north of Cairo. The Egyptian Railways Authority said it was still investigating what caused the Cairo-to-Mansoura train to crash. It was the third major rail accident Egypt in less than a month. At least 32 people were killed and 165 injured in March when two trains collided.

7 . US warns Russian on Navalny
Washington has told Russia there will be “consequences” if the Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny dies in jail. Navalny’s doctors say he “will die within the next few days” if he does not receive urgent medical attention for acute back pain and leg numbness. However, Russia’s ambassador to the UK has said that Navalny is attention seeking and “will not be allowed to die in prison”.

8 . Spies could be deported
Foreign spies in Britain could be prosecuted and deported under new laws, according to The Times. Boris Johnson is set to announce a bill next month to counter hostile states, including a requirement for all individuals working on behalf of foreign governments in Britain to register their presence. There is growing concern over the espionage activities of Russia and China.

9 . Covid tests could be VAT-free
Covid tests for holidaymakers could fall below £50 as the Treasury considers plans to exempt them from VAT. The government has already ruled that PCR tests will be exempt from VAT when they are administered or overseen by a registered nurse, but now all tests may be excluded from the 20% tax. Prices range from £60 to £300 per test.

10 . De Niro ‘being forced to act’
Robert De Niro is unable to turn down acting roles because he must pay for his estranged wife’s expensive tastes, according to his lawyer. Caroline Krauss told a Manhattan court that the Hollywood legend is struggling financially partly due to the demands of Grace Hightower, who filed for divorce in 2018. “Mr De Niro is 77 years old, and while he loves his craft, he should not be forced to work at this prodigious pace,” Krauss told the court.

‘Loneliest birthday’
The Sun says that Prince William and Harry were “united in grief” as the estranged brothers spoke for two hours after their grandfather’s funeral on Saturday. The Daily Mail says the Queen will have the “loneliest birthday” as she turns 95 on Wednesday.

Football hits the front pages today with plans for a European football Super League prompting an intervention from Downing Street. Boris Johnson has urged the six English clubs who have signed up to the plan not to progress any further, notes The Times.

Meanwhile, The Guardian quotes a retiring chief constable who says the best way to reduce crime is to cut poverty and inequality. Andy Cooke tells the paper that if he were given £5bn to slash crime, he would use £4bn to tackle poverty.

Police struggled to ‘keep up’ with confusing Covid laws
Watchdog warns ministers that regulations are passed in Parliament rather than ‘from a podium’

Dear Varkeychan,

The image of ministers announcing new coronavirus rules from behind a lectern has become a familiar sight on televisions across the nation.

But this week the police watchdog has pointed out that this is not where the country’s laws are made. The ever-changing guidance issued by the government left not only the public confused, but also the very people tasked with policing the pandemic.

‘Widespread confusion’
Police struggled to ‘keep up’ with confusing coronavirus laws
UK police forces have “felt disadvantaged by a lack of notice and consultation” about Covid laws, according to inspectors.

The newly published “Policing in the Pandemic” report, from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services, says that some police chiefs first learned about last year’s law changes from the government’s daily televised briefing.

The police watchdog says “it was hard to keep up” with the regulations, which were amended and supplemented a “considerable number of times” as “lockdown restrictions were eased or strengthened, imposed, relaxed and re-imposed, in different parts of the country, for different periods and with differing intensities”.

‘It’s naive to think working from home will come at no cost to employees’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

“According to a survey published by Deloitte, over a fifth of workers have little to no interest in returning to the office,” writes Kate Andrews in The Telegraph. For many who had office-based jobs pre-Covid, the “perks” of working from home are “not contentious: no commute, home-cooked lunches, and, for those already established in their careers, a mortgage-free work space. What’s not to like, in a world with no trade-offs?” But “the trouble, of course, is that there are trade-offs”, Andrews continues. “Major tech giants, including Facebook and Slack, started talking about a ‘salary-by-location’ shift months ago, which would mean a lack of commute is reflected in one’s pay packet.” Given this trend, “it would be naive to think those benefiting from a surreal, locked-down year will continue to do so at no cost: a reality it would appear millions have yet to accept”.

Can Dominic Cummings sink Boris Johnson?
Ally warns that PM’s former aide ‘knows where all the bodies are buried’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Dominic Cummings exited the political stage through the famous No. 10 front door with a theatrical flourish last year - lugging a large storage box.

While some critics celebrated his departure, Tories are now apparently “terrified” about what else the maverick former aide has carried out of Downing Street. According to his allies, it is a “treasure chest” of emails, memos and texts that threaten to embarrass his former boss.

The big fight
Can Dominic Cummings sink Boris Johnson?
The briefing war between Boris Johnson and the man who was once his most influential adviser is raging on in the newspapers today.

Downing Street is engaged in what the Daily Mail describes as a “spectacular public war of words” with Dominic Cummings, the Brexit campaign architect who was booted out of his role as Johnson’s chief of staff late last year.

Some Tory insiders fear the maverick former aide has enough material to damage the prime minister.

Covid ‘storm’
Indian government accused of hiding true death toll
The Indian government is massively underreporting the scale of the country’s Covid crisis, experts are claiming.

India recorded 349,691 new cases yesterday - setting a new global record for the fifth consecutive day - and 2,767 coronavirus deaths. But medical workers say those totals, “however staggering”, represent just “a fraction of the real reach of the virus’s spread, which has thrown the country into emergency mode”, The New York Times reports.

Downing Street has denied that a senior government official gave the controversial European Super League (ESL) the “green light” at a meeting with a top football club executive just days before Boris Johnson publicly opposed the scheme.

Dan Rosenfield, Johnson’s chief of staff at No. 10, appeared to “offer support” for the creation of the heavily criticised ESL in a meeting with Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward ten days ago, according to The Sunday Times.

Expert's view
Why inflation might surge after the Covid pandemic
Inflation is rising again in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics. Prices in March rose 0.7% compared to a year earlier, against a 0.4% rise in February. One of the main drivers was that fuel prices have seen their biggest increase since January 2020.

This rise in inflation is roughly in line with what analysts were expecting. The Bank of England has been expecting inflation to rise this spring as well, but thinks it will then settle down.

‘Radical policy changes are needed to fix the housing crisis’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “Securing a place to call one’s own is a key marker of independence, and a step towards starting a family,” says the Financial Times in its leader column. “Yet for many young people, across many countries, a home has become unaffordable and renting is insecure, expensive, or both – especially in places where the good jobs they want are most plentiful,” the paper continues. “[U]nless they enjoy support from the ‘bank of mum and dad’ or are exceptionally well paid, many in the younger generation are stuck as ‘generation rent’.” One of the most crucial issues the UK government must tackle is the “inadequate growth in supply, including of affordable housing”. Fixing the housing crisis will take “some radical policy changes. It is time to embrace them,” the paper concludes.

The battle to free Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe
British-Iranian mother jailed for a further year after being found guilty of ‘propaganda’ in Iran
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, sentenced to another year in prison in Iran, revealed today that he has not yet broken the news to their daughter Gabriella, who had been counting down the days until she could see her mother again.

The fresh heartbreak of her family should provide plenty of motivation for the UK government to do all it can to help them reunite after years of Zaghari-Ratcliffe being used as a political pawn.

The battle to free Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been sentenced to a further year in jail and given a one-year travel ban after being found guilty of “propaganda” against the Iranian regime.

Confirming the charges against his wife, Richard Ratcliffe said the decision was “clearly a negotiating tactic” by Tehran, with discussions over the country’s nuclear programme currently ongoing in Vienna.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s lawyer said the charges related to a demonstration she attended outside the Iranian embassy in London 12 years ago, after which she gave an interview to the BBC Persian service.

In a letter to the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group that “appears to kick Boris Johnson’s promise of an inquiry into the long grass”, says The Guardian, the government's legal department argues that “an inquiry now is not appropriate” because ministers and officials are too busy.

‘Rampant Covid in poorer countries will shape the evolution of the virus’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

Last week there were more than 5.8 million new cases of Covid across the world, the highest number yet, says Laura Spinney in The Guardian. The “sharpest upticks” have been seen in south-east Asia, the eastern Mediterranean and western Pacific regions, while the “situation is also very bad in Latin America”. We can be confident that poorer countries will contribute most of this year’s Covid deaths and “we should remember that rich countries are not immune from what happens beyond their shores”, says Spinney. “Rampant Covid in countries such as India and Brazil will shape the evolution of the virus and could cause new, even more dangerous variants to emerge, which neither our borders nor our vaccines are guaranteed to keep out.”

India passes 200,000 Covid deaths
New variant pushing healthcare system to breaking point
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Over the past week almost half of the world’s new Covid infections and around one in six deaths have occurred in a single country.

India, the self-proclaimed “pharmacy of the world”, is firmly in the grip of the most devastating Covid wave on the planet, with cases topping 300,000 per day and hospitals pushed beyond breaking point.

daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . India passes 200,000 Covid deaths
India’s Covid death toll has passed the 200,000 mark in another grim milestone for a nation facing what the BBC describes as a “ferocious” second wave. Dr Anthony Fauci, the White House’s chief medical adviser, said countries have failed to unite to prevent the “tragic” outbreak from overwhelming India. With only 1.6% of the population fully vaccinated, former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said the G7 must act to end “vaccine apartheid”.

2 . Nearly 40m in ‘Covid-free’ areas
More than 38 million people in England live in areas that are virtually Covid-free, The Times reports. Analysis by the paper found that seven in 10 people live in areas where a maximum of two infections were reported during the most recent week for which data is available. Alastair Grant, a professor of ecology at the University of East Anglia, said “the virus is retreating to small areas”. However, he added that many of the remaining hotspots are “deprived inner-city areas”.

3 . Foster facing DUP rebellion
Arlene Foster is facing a revolt from Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) members that could topple her as party leader and first minister of Northern Ireland. Several DUP assembly members have signed a letter calling for an “unprecedented leadership contest”, the BBC reports. The Guardian says a leadership challenge would “add further turmoil to a region already rattled by street disturbances linked to the post-Brexit Irish Sea border”.

4 . Self-driving cars allowed this year
Motorists could legally allow their cars to “self-drive” on British motorways later this year, the government has announced. The Department for Transport said the first vehicles fitted with Automated Lane Keeping Systems could be permitted to steer themselves in slow moving traffic before the end of 2021. Use of the system, which takes over control of the vehicle at low speeds, for example keeping it in lane on motorways, will be capped at 37mph (60 kph).

5 . Dyson slams ‘grotesque’ reports
James Dyson has accused the BBC of a “grotesque mischaracterisation” of his links with the Conservative Party. Writing in The Telegraph, the British inventor and billionaire denied trying to “extract favours from the prime minister”. Dyson hit the headlines last week when the BBC published messages showing that he sought clarification from Boris Johnson on UK tax matters related to building ventilators during the pandemic.

6 . Conservatives tell Johnson to own up
Tory MPs are demanding that Boris Johnson comes clean about the funding of his flat refurbishment. The prime minister has faced “growing disquiet” from within his own party following claims that he was loaned £58,000 from Conservative party funds, The Guardian says. It comes after the paper revealed that former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling refused to join a trust overseeing Downing Street upkeep citing “the potential for donors to expect political favours”.

7 . ‘Terrific’ data on vaccine efficacy
A single dose of a Covid vaccine can reduce household transmission of the virus by up to half, a new study has revealed. Public Health England found that those given a first dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines - and who became infected three weeks later - were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus on than unvaccinated people. Health Secretary Matt Hancock welcomed the data, describing it as “terrific news”.

8 . Idaho joins anti-abortion ‘flurry’
Idaho has signed into law a ban on most abortions at the onset of a fetal heartbeat, which can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. “We should never relent in our efforts to protect the lives of the preborn”, said Republican governor Brad Little as he announced the bill had been signed. CNN reports that there has been a “flurry” of anti-abortion bills in the early months of the Biden administration, including the introduction of similar measures in Oklahoma and Montana.

9 . Johnson ‘failed’ Zaghari-Ratcliffe
Boris Johnson has been described as a “dismal failure” after Iran sentenced Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe to a further year in jail. Labour’s Tulip Siddiq, Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s local MP, questioned the effort the prime minister had put into releasing her constituent, telling the House of Commons: “From where I’m standing, I’ve seen no evidence on the part of the prime minister so far.” In 2016, while serving as foreign secretary, Johnson wrongly told the Foreign Affairs Select Committee that the British-Iranian mother had been “simply teaching people journalism” when she was detained in Tehran.

10 . Bieber accused of cultural appropriation
Justin Bieber has been accused of cultural appropriation after changing his hairstyle. After the Canadian singer revealed his new dreadlock-style hair on Instagram, he was described by critics of being being a “dilettante... dipping his toe in the culture”. Stephanie Cohen, co-founder at the Halo Collective, a natural hair organisation, told The Guardian: “When I see a white person in mainstream media sporting a black hairstyle, it makes me angry.”

today’s newspapers
‘Come clean, Boris’
The Guardian leads on reports that Boris Johnson is being “urged to come clean” about the funding of his 11 Downing Street flat refurbishment. The PM is facing “growing disquiet” among senior Tories over allegations surrounding a £58,000 loan from Tory Party HQ, the paper says. “Cash for curtains” is the Daily Mirror’s splash as it says the PM is “mired in scandal”.

The Daily Mail reports that self-driving cars are to be legal on UK motorways this year. The paper adds that there are concerns drivers “will be able to check their emails and watch TV” under plans to legalise the technology within months.

“June olé days” is The Sun’s headline as it reports that the Spanish tourism minister has confirmed June as “the start of the recovery of tourism in Spain”.

Why the DUP turned on Arlene Foster
Arlene Foster has resigned as DUP leader and Northern Ireland first minister after three-quarters of her party’s Assembly members and half of its MPs signed a letter of no confidence in her.

She said “she would step down as DUP leader on 28 May and as first minister at the end of June”, reports the BBC.

Foster told Sky News that serving the people of Northern Ireland had been “the privilege of my life” and added: “The future of unionism and Northern Ireland will not be found in division. It will only be found in sharing this place we are privileged to call home.”

‘Britain has a potentate in place of a prime minister’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “Instead of a cabinet, Britain has courtiers. In place of a prime minister, there is a potentate,” writes Rafael Behr in The Guardian. “The traditional structures still exist, but as tributes to an obsolescent way of governing.” There are still secretaries of state, but they now have “little bearing on real power, which swirls in an unstable vortex of advisers and officials vying for proximity to Boris Johnson’s throne”. Behr continues that “having such a personality at the heart of government makes a nonsense of unwritten protocol” that governs British politics. “It was never rigorous. All manner of hypocrisies flourish when a self-selecting elite chooses the boundaries of legitimate behaviour. But there were boundaries. Johnsonism has none.”

Cash for curtains: will No. 10 refurb inquiry end up costing PM?
Pundits say Electoral Commission probe may have ‘serious consequences’ for Boris Johnson
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Watching Boris Johnson tell reporters there is “nothing to see here” over the Downing Street refurbishment furore today was much like watching The Naked Gun’s Frank Drebin saying the same in front of an exploding fireworks factory.

The question for the PM is just how far the “cash for curtains” row might blow up.

Cash for curtains
Will No. 10 refurb inquiry end up costing PM?
The Conservatives are facing an Electoral Commission inquiry over allegations that a donor originally paid for renovations to Boris Johnson’s Downing Street flat.

The political finances watchdog has said that the party’s compliance with laws on donations will be assessed because “there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred”.

The inquiry has the potential “to imperil Boris Johnson’s premiership”, The Guardian warned following yesterday’s announcement, as the so-called “cash for curtains” row “rapidly engulfed” the prime minister.

Has Biden lived up to his ‘quiet radical’ reputation?
Joe Biden has marked his first 100 days in the White House with an address to Congress in which he laid out his $1.8trn (£1.3trn) spending package to revive the US economy.

Half a century after he entered Congress as a senator, Biden said his administration would overhaul US infrastructure and social programmes with policies funded by “corporate America and the wealthiest 1%” paying their “fair share”.

‘Final step of Brexit’
What next for the EU and UK?
The European Parliament has approved the post-Brexit trade deal between the EU and UK, marking what Boris Johnson has called the “final step in a long journey”.

MEPs backed the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which has been provisionally in force since 1 January, by 660 votes to just five. The prime minister said it was now “time to look forward to the future”, prompting speculation about how the country’s relationship with the EU might unfold.

Is coronavirus found in British bats a threat?
News that a new coronavirus similar to the one that causes Covid-19 has been found in British bats may not be welcomed by many members of the public.

But ecology student Ivana Murphy, from the University of East Anglia (UEA), made just such a discovery while “collecting bat droppings as part of her final-year dissertation”, reports The Times. As the newspaper notes, “It is the first time a sarbecovirus - of which Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid, is one type - has been found in bats in the UK”.

‘After a footballing career, players have 50 years of leftover life to kill’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

“I felt sorry for Mark Noble, hauled off last Saturday for West Ham against Chelsea,” writes Hunter Davies in the New Statesman. “Noble is getting on, but can be relied upon to give hope to his team.” Is substitution “the worst thing that can happen to a player?” asks Davies. “All their millions in the bank, their fame and status, count for nothing in that moment of public humiliation.” Of course not, says Davies. “Let me count the worser ways.” He goes on: “Life after football is the longest, most depressing thing they have to face – empty decades stretching ahead, leftover life to kill.” “Divorce is very common in retirement. Then there are the ailments that may have been caused or exacerbated by their career, such as arthritis and dementia,” he continues. “So would you do it if you had a choice? Take 15 years of glory and 50 years of emptiness?”

		Mother’s Day is a complicated holiday: by turns sweet, poignant, and painful for those in the throes of motherhood, longing for it, or recovering from the faults of their own mother figure. I am in the sweet phase, with two little girls who no doubt will offer crayon-scribbled cards with our traditional platter of doughnuts. But I came to motherhood after many years of painful infertility and every Mother’s Day I pause to think of those there now. So I offer this bundle of recipes and stories hoping there is something for nearly everyone: those celebrating, hoping, wishing, and healing.

Conservatives triumph in Hartlepool
Starmer faces questions about Labour’s direction
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The first result from yesterday’s bumper crop of elections - a Conservative win deep in Labour territory - had been widely trailed, but the wide margin of victory was more of a surprise.

For Keir Starmer, the inquest has already begun. Even before the loss was confirmed, he was facing criticism from two camps within his party: one which says he must make a more decisive break from the Corbyn years, and another which says he has already gone too far.

daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . Conservatives triumph in Hartlepool
Hartlepool has a Conservative MP for the first time since the seat was created in 1974 after the Labour candidate Paul Williams attracted little more than half the votes of his Tory rival Jill Mortimer. The by-election was “a key test of Labour’s appeal to its traditional heartlands”, says The Guardian, and defeat will leave “Keir Starmer facing huge questions over the future direction of his party”.

2 . Economy bouncing back, says Bank
The Bank of England says Britain is on course for its strongest year of economic growth since the Second World War as households splash their lockdown savings and businesses increase their investment. After contracting by 9.8% in the worst recession since 1709 last year, growth will bounce back to 7.25% this year. Sandra Horsfield, UK economist at Investec, described the forecasts as “a hefty upward revision”.

3 . Girl shoots pupils at US school
A girl aged 11 or 12 girl has shot and wounded two of her fellow students and a member of staff at a school in Idaho. Police say the pupil brought a gun to Rigby Middle School and opened fire. A teacher disarmed the girl and detained her until police took her into custody. The three victims are expected to survive, officials said. President Joe Biden recently announce steps to tighten gun controls following a string of mass shootings.

4 . Inquiry calls for NHS spending surge
Spending on the NHS needs to rise by £102bn over the next decade, a commission has concluded. According to a four-year inquiry by the London School of Economics and the Lancet medical journal, the funding injection would cut avoidable deaths from cancer and heart disease, tackle health inequalities and rebuild the NHS after the pandemic. It said the new funds should come largely from tax increases.

5 . Modi’s costly revamp angers India
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has come under fire for pushing ahead with a £1.3bn parliamentary revamp, including a new home, during the country’s Covid surge. The costly renovation has been categorised as an “essential service” so construction is allowed to continue even when most building projects have been paused. CNN says the public and opposition politicians are “infuriated” and two citizens have lodged a case with the Delhi High Court to try to halt construction.

6 . Twitter suspends Trump-linked account
Twitter has suspended an account sharing content from Donald Trump’s new communications platform. The account claimed to be tweeting “on behalf” of the former US president but the social media giant said the account broke the rules by helping the former president to circumvent his ban from the social network. Trump launched his own communications platform - titled “From the Desk of Donald J Trump” - on Tuesday.

7 . Travel costs will rise says boss
Holiday costs are set to rise this year due to pent-up demand and fewer aeroplanes in service, a travel boss has warned. Despite huge demand, uncertainty makes it hard for airlines to plan bringing more planes back into service, said Booking.com’s chief executive Glenn Fogel. “There’s so much pent-up demand,” said Fogel. “Everybody wants to go travelling, but we all want to do it safely.”

8 . North Korea says leaflets could have Covid
Authorities in North Korea say propaganda leaflets sent via balloon over the border with the South could be carrying Covid-19. The state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper urged people to stay away from the leaflets, saying: “Even when we come across a strange object flying in the wind, we must consider them as a possible route of transmission of the malicious virus rather than a natural phenomenon.” North Korea has previously described the leaflets as “an intolerable provocation”.

9 . Lineker in stand-off with taxman
The broadcaster Gary Lineker is being pursued for £4.9m in tax and national insurance in what The Times describes as “the most high-profile battle so far between HMRC and celebrities”. The tax authority says the former England footballer owes £3.62m in income tax and £1.31m in national insurance because he should have been taxed as a direct employee of the BBC and BT Sport. A source close to Lineker described the proceedings as “a shambles”.

10 . Historian disciplined over Meghan remarks
An art historian has been disciplined after referring to “dreaded Meghan” and “people of colourful disposition”. Dr Anne Anderson of the Arts Society in Truro made the comments during a Zoom lecture. Speaking of the aftermath of Meghan and Harry’s interview with Oprah, she said: “You couldn’t turn the television on without some person of a colourful disposition having a moan about something.”

		Curated by Food52 	
		Celebrating Asian American & Pacific Islander Heritage Month this year feels perhaps more urgent than ever before, in the wake of anti-Asian sentiments and hate crimes fueled by the coronavirus pandemic. And celebrate we will. While we’re slowly returning to some in-person gatherings, there remain plenty of ways to connect online. We, of course, gravitated to storytelling through food—be it saluting traditional recipes passed down for generations or celebrating riffs on American dishes that have become classics across the Asian diaspora. Indeed, the diversity of cuisines and experiences from the AAPI community is vast: We had a hard time stopping short at just a handful of pieces. We’re sharing some of the work that has made a big impact on us lately. We hope you’ll read it, and join us in celebrating AAPI food and culture—this month, and beyond.

Good morning Varkeychan,

Let’s start with a game in today’s free edition. Pick the right option:

a) Betting on sports is illegal in India
b) Running a betting platform for sports is illegal in India

Hint: The answer isn’t binary.

Okay, next:

a) Reliance is a green energy champion
b) Reliance is going to be one of the largest gas producers in India

Hint: It’s Reliance, duh.

And finally:

a) WFH improves productivity
b) WFH destroys productivity

Before you answer that, you might want to take a quick peek at The Ken’s first-ever productivity survey results. And oh, there’s an 8 AM read you don’t want to miss!

PS: Did you know Slack has dedicated WFH emojis now? Which one’s your favourite? Mine, by a mile, is  <cat runs across the keyboard>

Are you watching the Euro 2020 football tournament? Got an office pool on who’s going to win? If you’re watching the football on streaming platform SonyLIV, you might have even seen ads of international betting companies like Betway. But they never use the word “bet” in the ads. It’s always “predict”. 

Why? Because sports betting is illegal in India. 

But then how are these platforms still advertising and operating in India, you ask? Good question. No one seems to know. A couple of stories in the media late last year when the ads first cropped up had various authorities—broadcasters, governing bodies, banks, and governments—passing the buck to each other as to whose responsibility it is to take action. But you would’ve thought at least one party would have cracked the whip by now.

So, after spotting more such ads while watching the Euro 2020 football last week, I decided to register on a couple of these websites to understand how they’re getting around Indian laws.

What I found was pretty amazing. On Betway, I was offered a 100% matched deposit bonus on a minimum deposit of Rs 500 (US$6.7). Basically, if I put in Rs 500, the platform would add another Rs 500 from their side, giving me a balance of Rs 1,000 (US$13.5) to bet with. 

The payment options included online banking, cards, and even UPI, India’s real-time payments system. And there were some other payment gateways I had never even heard of. 

Now, here’s where things got interesting. I clicked on the UPI option. It took me to a page that had details of the UPI ID I had to transfer the money to. The name “Betway” was nowhere to be found. The UPI ID was rhs44@icici. I logged into Google Pay and entered the ID. It was an ICICI Bank account registered under the name of JAI AMBE AGRO TRADERS. A quick Google search reveals several companies in various cities like Jalgaon, Vadodara, and Nashik with similar names.

A few days later, yesterday, while writing this piece, I tried it again. This time, there was a different ICICI Bank UPI ID: saurav1819@icici. It was registered under the name of SK ENTERPRISES. The account was set up in June 2021.

The process was similar on other platforms like Dafabet and Bet365. I then wrote to the customer service of some of these platforms asking if betting is legal in India and whether there would be any trouble if I placed bets. I got a standard response:

Betway and Bet365 are both registered in Malta, a tax haven, while Dafabet was founded in the Philippines. Technically, they’re not Indian companies and have no official presence in India. But they’re offering services that are illegal in India to Indian users. Pretty openly. How is that possible?

I put these questions to Seshank Shekar Rayaprolu, counsel at LawNK, a Bengaluru-based law firm that specialises in sports, gaming and media laws. These are some excerpts from our chat:

Q. Just because these companies are not registered in India, are they not culpable under Indian law?

They seem to be a little bold in [assuming] that they won’t be subject to any action under Indian law. It’s like, let’s say, a pornographic website. They may not be operating from India, but they’re offering pornography to users based in India.

 Q. But porn is not illegal in India, right?

Accessing porn is not illegal, but manufacturing, publishing, and circulating it is. Similarly here, while some state laws have punishment for individuals who are actually betting, the bias is towards people who are offering it and who are organising betting or gambling operations. 

Q. So then, how have none of the Indian authorities pounced on this yet? 

Yeah, it’s puzzling. The issue, I think to some extent, is that gaming and gambling is a state matter, so state governments have to take the initiative. Some states have passed laws banning betting, but they’ve not done anything else after that. They don’t proactively block websites in their state.

Q. Fantasy sports is considered a game of skill in India, and is legal. Isn’t there a very thin line between fantasy sports and sports betting? 

Not necessarily, because fantasy sports companies don’t let you try and win based on a binary outcome. The argument is that there is more skill involved because you’re building a team with a set budget and all of that, which is also being held under Indian law. But for betting, there’s nothing like that—you can basically hedge on a binary outcome. And once you do that, it’s not considered a game of skill in India. 

Q. So, basically, these betting companies have put the onus on the users in India…

Correct. I think if they get caught, they’ll just push it on to the users. And if they’re asked to stop operating and shut down, it’s just the user funds that are in danger, right? They will say that you accessed it at your own risk and we don’t have any responsibility for it. 

Q.  That explains the random UPI accounts…

Yes, and they keep changing the accounts, so it’s clearly not completely legitimate. They seem to have got some local operators here, handling all the Indian money. So the money is never leaving India. Basically, somebody’s operating a bank account here on their behalf. Betway’s name never shows up in your transactions. 

Last year, there were some articles that said this could be a FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) violation. But a FEMA violation will come into effect only if the money is going out [of India]. I don’t know how someone can actually prove that the money is going out. 

But using Indian banks’ payment gateways is pretty puzzling because, generally, banks are very thorough and ask for legal opinions. They make sure that it’s a game of skill, and only then allow these guys to hook up their payments to them. Maybe they’re not aware of what it’s being used for. 

Q. What about the advertisements? How are you allowed to advertise betting platforms on streaming websites?

You’re actually not allowed to advertise gambling or betting in India. They’re using a surrogate branding kind of system where they advertise it as a prediction app, and not a betting or gambling app. Dafabet has even established a sports news website called Dafanews. 

Q. So, as a user, should you think twice before using these platforms?

Yeah, especially with tax implications. You’re technically supposed to pay a 33% tax on winnings. And the platforms are doing a KYC check by asking for PAN and Aadhaar details while registering. They’re covering their backs if their records are ever requested by the government. 

As a user, it’s not legal to actually bet in India. While the bias in terms of law enforcement is to go after the organisers rather than people who bet, that doesn’t mean you’re not at risk. Especially when it comes to large amounts. I think the risk is much higher when you’re actually winning and not declaring it.

***
So, in case you’re wondering whether to give these betting platforms a shot, friendly advice: don’t. They don’t have much to lose. After all, sports betting is a US$200 billion industry globally. Bet365 recorded a revenue of GBP 2.76 billion (US$3.83 billion) and profit of GBP 129.3 million (US$175.4 million) for the year ended March 2020.If you still go ahead and bet, at the very least, pay your taxes accordingly.

PS: During the World Test Championship cricket final last week, I saw some prediction videos on Twitter posted by cricketer-turned-broadcaster Aakash Chopra, sponsored by Betway. At the end of the videos, he asks viewers to log into Betway and “predict”. Never “bet”.

RIL – stepping on the gas, again
Anand Kalyanaraman

Two announcements at Reliance Industries’ (RIL) recent AGM (annual general meeting) hogged the limelight—the company’s green energy push and the impending launch of the JioPhone Next smartphone. Lost in the din and the razzmatazz was a seemingly innocuous statement by chairman Mukesh Ambani.  

In its exploration and production (E&P) business (the company’s ‘upstream’ oil & gas mining business), bp and Reliance JV commenced production in the KGD6 basin. In record time, it brought two of its three deep water gas projects to production. And it’s on course to add the third. 
This will establish Reliance again as one of the largest producers of gas in India, meeting 20% of India's gas demand. E&P will again be a source of significant value and sustained earnings growth over the next decade.”

Why is this significant? Primarily because E&P has been the rare miss in RILs’ hit parade—refining, petrochemicals, telecom, retail—over the past two decades. The business has been languishing for years for a variety of reasons, ranging  from pricing disputes to production declines. Both its key bets in the domestic market (Krisha Godavari (KG) offshore block) and in the international market (US shale gas) did not live up to expectations. 

Much hope was riding on the KG-D6 block but it flattered to deceive. Gas production here started in April 2009, quickly zoomed to 60 mmscmd (million metric standard cubic metre per day), and was expected to rise much more. But instead, output fell drastically and eventually touched single-digit territory. While RIL blamed geological complexity, the government blamed the company for not drilling enough wells and also accused it of gold-plating costs. A messy legal row ensued. Some also alleged that RIL was suppressing output for want of a good price; the company, of course, dismissed this.

Even global energy major bp that took about 30% stake in the business for top-dollar couldn’t turn things around. Also, the company’s bet on US shale gas came a cropper due to pricing challenges. Ergo, the E&P business turned a dud and stuck out like a sore thumb. Its share in the company’s total revenue shrunk to insignificance and it posted serial losses in contrast to the other profit-churning businesses. In the year ended March 2021, the E&P business posted an operating (EBIT) loss of Rs 1,477 crore (~US$200 million).

But RIL has stepped on the gas again. 

Along with bp, it started production in two wells in the KG-D6 block last year. The output has increased to 12.8 mmscmd, and going by Ambani’s commentary, it should hit 30 mmscmd in a couple of years with a third well. It helps, of course, that gas pricing rules are now more favourable for new fields, especially for deep-sea ones. 

But oil and gas E&P is a notoriously unpredictable business, especially in deep-sea fields—something RIL knows well. Yet, if it manages to pull it off this time around and the path-to-profitability fructifies as planned, RIL’s cash register will ring louder. 

Now, isn’t the company’s renewed focus on natural gas—a fossil fuel—at odds with RIL’s new green energy push? Well, arguably, it is. But then, gas is considered relatively clean, compared with its dirtier cousins such as oil and coal. The Indian government is also batting for its increased use. Trust RIL to have its cake and eat it too.

		Hello, and welcome to some of the most fascinating stories I flipped for in the last week. To start, Kathryn A. Whitehead’s TED Talk offers one of the clearest explanations I’ve ever heard of the science behind mRNA treatments and how they forge the path for therapies that could treat Ebola, HIV and even cancer. An excerpt from the book “Four Thousand Weeks” reveals that that’s how long an 80-year-old has on this earth, so, yes, distraction is truly the enemy. How people imagine their pets talking made me smile (cue Rocky the “whoodle” speaking like Werner Herzog). And no $72 fried rice for me. I prefer the indulgence of canned cocktails, not least because their packaging is so pretty.

		Interesting stories worth your time. 	
	
 
	
		Presented By 	
	FinanceBuzz 	
	
 
	
		Of all the writing on Afghanistan this week, Air Force veteran Ian Fritz’s essay about listening in on 600 hours of Taliban conversations was among the most insightful. I also loved Slate’s podcast about the family who saw Jesus in a tortilla in ’77. I learned that the key of D minor is so sad even the most somber rockers avoid it. And because I am as invested in gossip as Anne Helen Petersen, I couldn't resist her juicy dissection of Peloton instructor Ally Love's blitz of a wedding.

HOW IT WORKS
Format and scoring

What is the format?

The Ryder Cup has always been decided by match-play, pitting the players against each other rather than the scoreboard. There are 28 matches, each worth one point to the winners.

The first two days see foursomes in the morning, followed by fourballs in the afternoon. Fourball matches involve four players, two from each side, and the player with the lowest score wins the hole for his team. Foursomes is more like doubles, with two players from each team taking it in turns to take a shot. Sunday, the third and final day, will see 12 singles matches take place.

    Friday: foursomes (four matches) and fourballs (four matches)
    Saturday: foursomes (four matches) and fourballs (four matches)
    Sunday: 12 singles matches

How does the scoring system work?

There are a total 28 points up for grabs. The winner of each match gets one point, with half points for drawn games. Europe, the defending champions, require 14 points to retain the trophy, while the USA will need 14½ points to win it back.
