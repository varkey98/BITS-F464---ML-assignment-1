Subject: I-NCUBATE program GDC IIT Madras
From: "Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>
Date: 17-09-2021, 12:59

Dear Sir/Madam

On behalf of the Gopalakrishnan-Deshpande Centre for Innovation & Entrepreneurship (GDC), IIT Madras, we are pleased to invite you, your faculty colleagues, researchers, and students, to the Information Webinar for Cohort 18 of our flagship I-NCUBATE program. The session will be held on Monday, 27th September 2021 (4.30pm to 6.00pm).

 

The webinar will provide an overview of the 8-week-long I-NCUBATE program, and how it can help faculty and researchers commercialize their research by the way of a start-up. Attending the webinar can help them decide if they should apply for the upcoming Cohort 18, which begins on 30th October 2021.

 

GDC was established at IIT Madras by Dr. Gururaj Deshpande, Mrs. Jaishree Deshpande, and Mr. ‘Kris’ Gopalakrishnan. GDC works with faculty, researchers, and students from STEM universities across India to implement a ‘Lab to Market’ mission by helping them commercialize their research and build startups that create socio-economic impact at scale.

 

I-NCUBATE Online, based on the LEAN Startup concept, caters to early stage and science-based startups. About 10 teams come together as a cohort to go through a “Customer Discovery” exercise with their respective innovations. The program helps faculty members, researchers, and students improve their entrepreneurial capabilities, and think of innovative ways to build their research ideas into viable and scalable startups. 

 

So far, over 145 startup teams, led by academic faculty members from 30 leading STEM Colleges in India, have participated in and benefitted from the 17 Cohorts of I-NCUBATE program. Listen to faculty (and entrepreneurs) from past Cohorts explain how they and their start-ups benefitted from the I-NCUBATE program.

 

Participants have found the I-NCUBATE program to be transformational. Nearly 60% of participating faculty in past Cohorts of I-NCUBATE were creating a startup for the first time. Over 65% of participating teams have gone onwards to incorporate their startups after attending I-NCUBATE and have raised over Rs. 450 million in external funding so far.

 

We look forward to meeting you and your colleagues at the webinar on 27th September at 4:30 pm. Please click here to register for the Information Webinar.  

 

Best......Raghu

Greetings from the Student Alumni Relations Cell!

The Yearbook is a dedicated volume that captures the nostalgic memories of the graduating batch of an institute. The eventful years spent on the campus are engraved and expressed with photos and write-ups, a reminder of all the good times. Years down the line, when you look back, the yearbook will light up faded memories of walking down the NAB slope, late-night chai at ANC, birthday celebrations at -301 F, rushing for tutorials at the last minute and sleepless nights in the library before every exam. Visuals from these old, fleeting moments, photographs of your batchmates, stills from Oasis, inspiring words from your professors, and the aroma of all the food you made your wingies pay for will remind you of the institute that assisted you as you built yourself from the ground up.

 

The Student Alumni Relations Cell works throughout the year to publish the yearbook for the graduating class every year. This edition of the yearbook is exclusively meant for the First Degree batch of 2018 (single degree and dual degree) and the Higher Degree Batch of 2020.

We're excited to launch the Yearbook Portal 2022, a gateway to your college memories where you can post crazy pictures and interesting captions for yourselves and your friends. It is an effort from our side to help you relive your college life and capture those beautiful memories that you shared with your seniors, batchies and juniors.

Log into the Yearbook Portal

Please fill out the form if you wish to feature any of your captured photos of the campus in the Yearbook or have any concerns/queries.

As an attempt to clarify the numerous queries that might arise regarding the Yearbook Portal, we would like to clarify a few points:-

    There is a no-limit rule to the captions you can write about your friends!

    The deadline to fill your Yearbook Quote and Photo will be 10th October, 2021

    A printed hard copy of the Yearbook will be made available (the opt-in form will be shared later).

    The hardcopy would contain your caption, a.k.a yearbook quote with your picture.

    You can modify your yearbook quote before the deadline through the edit profile option. The entered yearbook quotes should be limited to 140 characters or 25 words. 

    Quotes to be written only in English (Important: Please refrain from using any expletives or Devanagari script).

    No emojis are to be used in the quotes.

    Please refrain from using photos with multiple people in them.

    Weird photos (such as those of anime characters, natural scenery, etc.) are not allowed.

    Uploading photos is a must for the yearbook.

Hello,
Greetings from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay's Techfest World MUN, 2021!  

In the past Twenty years, Techfest World MUN has become one of the best model United Nations conferences in Asia.

To: Faculty at Pilani Campus <faculty@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>, PhD Group Pilani Campus <phd@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>, Students at Pilani Campus <students@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>

Dear All,

We have activated the Trial Access to Sage Research methods in our IP ranges (available within campus). The access is available at URL: https://methods.sagepub.com/.

The trial access will expire on 10th October 2021


About Sage Research methods:

SAGE Research Methods supports research at all levels by providing material to guide users through every step of the research process. Nearly everyone at a university is involved in research, from students learning how to conduct research to faculty conducting research for publication to librarians delivering research skills training and doing research on the efficacy of library services. SAGE Research Methods has the answer for each of these user groups, from a quick dictionary definition, a case study example from a researcher in the field, a downloadable teaching dataset, a full-text title from the Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences series, or a video tutorial showing research in action.

SAGE Research Methods is the ultimate methods library with more than 1000 books, reference works, journal articles, and instructional videos by world-leading academics from across the social sciences, including the largest collection of qualitative methods books available online from any scholarly publisher. The site is designed to guide users to the content they need to learn a little or a lot about their method. The Methods Map can help those less familiar with research methods to find the best technique to use in their research. Built upon SAGE’s legacy of methods publishing, SAGE Research Methods is the essential online tool for researchers.

Hope you will find it useful for your research purpose.

Regards

Dr. Ranjan Sinha Thakur

Dear All,

We are excited to have you back on campus in good numbers after a gap of eighteen months (since March 2020). On-campus animal life comprising squirrels, hedgehogs and many bird species
(including our national bird peafowl, three types of doves and sunbird) roamed freely over this period. Our collective responsibility is to make sure that the animal life on campus continues to prosper
and flourish; as it did during the pandemic.

We have a significant peafowl population on campus. Their presence brings joy and peace to all campus residents. We ought to be extra careful after detecting the presence of the bird in our vicinity.
Our presence must not disturb the bird. 

If you encounter an injured bird, contact Prof. Sandhya Marathe (7733000698) or Prof. Sangeeta Sharma (9351388400).

Dear Students,

 

It has been decided to conduct the Mid Semester Test and Comprehensive Examination of First Semester 2021-22 in offline mode (physically in classrooms) for all the students admitted in AY 2020-21 and earlier.

 

As few batches of students have not yet returned back to the campus, in order to provide them sufficient transit time, the Mid Semester Test for all the students has been postponed and now will be rescheduled during October 25-30, 2021. Accordingly, all students admitted in AY 2020-21 and earlier need to return to the campus for which SWD, BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus will send separate communication.

 

In case, any student who will not able to return to campus due to genuine reason, he/she can apply for make-up exam of Mid Semester Test to the Instructor-in-charge (IC).  The make-up exam of Mid Semester Test shall be conducted at the Campus in offline mode by IC before the start of the Comprehensive Exam of First Semester 2021-22.

Greetings!
While some of us are extremely delighted to be allowed to come back to the campus, a lot of us are also worried by the compulsory mode of evaluations, the decision regarding which has been taken by those in the administration. One major cause of worry is surely the ongoing pandemic situation which can wreak havoc in a student's life. We have got to know that parents of a lot of the students are worried due to the same as well and some even have been overburdened by the financial constraints owing to the pandemic which have been further increased by the urgent call for all those eligible to compulsorily come to the campus. In order to bring to light the problems being faced by the students, we have created a google form [attached below] which can be used to raise the issues regarding campus reopening. The responses of the same would be shared with the higher authorities and we will try to ensure that something can be done for the betterment of the students. We request everyone to please fill the form as soon as possible so that all the issues can be brought to the notice of the administration without any delay. 
Link to the form- https://forms.gle/TXMBQ1vwZExiqaAz9

Subject: Get hired as a TATA Administrative Services (TAS) Manager, Tata Group’s flagship leadership programme | You're eligible, apply now

To: ASWIN BENEDICT <f20190579@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>

Hi ASWIN BENEDICT,

Tata group for the first time has opened the doors of Tata Administrative Services (TAS), an IAS equivalent of the private sector via Tata Imagination Challenge to all the students across domains.

TAS, Tata group's flagship leadership development program, was conceived by the legendary JRD Tata in 1956 as an elite service of young managers when he observed that there were people with impressive business acumen, but were limited by education or experience. Today the Tata Group has 30 companies in over 100+ countries and TAS Managers are leading it at every front and now they have opened their doors again to hire TAS Managers of batch 2022.

Link to Register: https://dare2compete.com/competition/tata-imagination-challenge-2021-tata-sons-213975?lb=FMailer

Eligibility: Every student enrolled in a full-time course across India and across domains - Engineering, Business, Arts, Commerce, Science, CA, etc. 

Apply now if you think you can be that leader who can take the Tata group to greater heights, who can add to their strength, as the Tata group is looking for more than those who just fit role titles and descriptions but want to #SettleForMore because the Tata group is more than a company and TAS is more than just a job.

All the best!

Regards,
Team Dare2Compete

        Dear Ashish and Naveeen,

        You may share one set of experimental data of drop impact on hexane deep pool for some intermediate weber number (possibly for the case of 10cm impact) with Aswin, copied in this mail, through Google Drive. He works on image processing in Matlab.

Dear Student,


You are allowed to leave for home after the mid-sem (only). The procedure for the same is as follows:


    The leave should be applied through a portal only. Any email/phone call for the leave won't be entertained.
    The respective hostel warden will approve the leave through the portal. Only after the approval you will be permitted to leave.
    The leave should be applied (through the portal) at least 24 hours before leaving the campus. 
    Only in case of any unavoidable circumstances, the time limit will be relaxed. 
    No phone calls for unnecessary requests will be entertained.
    Upon return from the break, a student has to produce the negative report of the RT-PCR done from an ICMR approved lab [ valid for 72 hours] (even if they are fully vaccinated).
    Parents won't be allowed inside campus when the students return from their post-mid-sem break.
    Remember, you can avail the leave once in the current semester.


P.S.: You will be receiving a notification about the portal very soon.


No queries in this regard will be entertained. We will cancel the leave request in case of receiving any email in this regard!


With best wishes,


Navin Singh

Dear BITSian,

 

Each year, BITSAA receives thousands of applications for Merit cum Need scholarships to fund their tuition fees and various initiatives for the enrichment of the student experience in BITS.

 

A single pledge for monthly sustained giving from you can make an immense difference in a student’s life, and assist various crucial programs BITSAA runs for the student community.

 

No amount is too small. If a batch of 500 pledge to donate Rs. 500 a month, they can potentially support Merit-cum-Needs scholarships for 15 students a year!* A small pledge from us alumni can create a huge impact for the students. Please join us in making this recurring donor drive a success.We don’t need to wait for jubilee celebrations to give back to our community. BIT BY BIT we build BITS!

International Donations:

-> Please make sure you choose the “Monthly” option while donating

https://www.bitsaa.org/g/bit-by-bit-for-bits

 

 

India Donations:

-> NEFT payment mode available now. Card payment / Netbanking method will be added soon

https://www.bitsaa.org/page/bit-by-bit-for-bits

 

Funds generated through this campaign will be disbursed to specific students or groups based on need or merit. The funds will support Merit-cum-Needs scholarships, enable student activities including travel for competitions, scholarships for off campus research and international thesis as well as provide financial support for student projects. We will continue to work with the institute to identify areas of maximum impact.

 

Please contact us at <fundraising-team@bitsaa.org> for Naming Rights or an Institutionalized Fund if you are considering giving a large donation. Corporate gift-matching is a very powerful tool for charitable causes and we support and encourage it. Every donation in India is eligible for 100% deduction on income tax under section 80G. 

*Merit cum Need scholarships cover 40-50% of college tuition fees.

With Love,

Dear All,

In a historic event, a BITS Pilani student has launched his second rap song across all music platforms making him BITS Pilani's First-Ever Professional Rapper.

The artist behind this rap song - Dhiraj Singh Pawar is currently studying at the Pilani campus.

This song titled 'KHUDGARZ' is a fierce reminder for all the artists out there to continue creating art even if the odds aren't in their favor.

The song is an amalgamation of the London Underground Drill and Grime scene tweaked for the Indian Hip-hop culture. 
An apt song for playing on loud woofers- you'll surely end up vibing with this one.

We urge our BITSian community to show their support by streaming this song on any music streaming platform of their choice:

Link for all music streaming platforms: 
https://dhiraj.streamlink.to/khudgarz

Link for Dhiraj's Rap page: 
instagram.com/rapbydhiraj


We hope that the song fills you up with energy and motivates you to keep going- even when the time is dark.


Best regards,
Dhiraj Singh Pawar (2019A3PS0286P)

Subject: Hostel Allotment (Revised)
From: Chief Warden <chiefwarden@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>

To: undisclosed-recipients:;
BCC: f20190579@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in

Dear Student,

Please find the revised list of allotments. We understand that many of you are not getting a room as per your expectations. Remember one thing, once you are on campus and meeting your friends, I am sure that you will forget all the grievances you are having. In this phase, we have called the students based on the availability of locked rooms. The data is very dynamic due to many reasons.

Please find your allotment of the room from the http://swd.bits-pilani.ac.in/Login.aspx.

Here are general answers to the queries you have posted.

Common Queries:

1. Want a single room but have been allotted a double room?

We are aware of the fact that some of the rooms have been left unoccupied. This is due to inadequate data because of the fast and dynamic process in the current scenario.
The empty/locked rooms will be allocated once things settle down. Please be patient until then. All the unoccupied rooms can be allotted on request from 17th October onwards.
If you and some of your friends agree to mutual shifting, we will sort out the issue after your arrival.

2. Allotted rooms are occupied by PS or off-campus TS students?

You may stay with your friend or get a room with the help of the respective hostel superintendent for the time being. After 17th October, if required depending on the vacancy, we will try to re-allocate you.

We expect your cooperation in the process and hope that you understand the situation right now. Please be rest assured that we are with you in the whole room allotment process and trying to do our best.

With best regards,

Navin Singh

Greetings from NSS, BITS Pilani!

The relationship between seniors and juniors at BITS is a special one. College seniors are supposed to be the first mentors for the young adults far from home. But sometimes, in the name of introduction or initiation, millions of students are brutally abused in many educational institutions. 

Ragging and bullying are one of the leading causes of mental health depreciation among students. Thus to change, spread awareness, and take action, NSS, BITS PILANI has collaborated with S.A.V.E : Society Against Violence in Education and invited Mr. Ajay Govind, Mr. Gaurav Singhal and Mr. Shivam Yadav to enlighten about the harmful effects of ragging and help us formulate a strong anti-ragging mindset.

About the Speakers

Ajay Govind is an award-winning filmmaker, educator and anti-ragging activist. Being a graduate of St. Stephen's College (Delhi University), he has interacted with over 15,000 participants. Ajay's anti-ragging documentary film 'Thereby Hangs a Tale' has won accolades all across India and has been associated with S.A.V.E.,(no2ragging.org) since last about a decade when one of his close friends lost his life due to ragging.

Gaurav Singhal is Vice-President and the R.T.I. Cell Head of S.A.V.E. Perturbed with the murder of a medical student in the name of ragging in 2009, he joined the Anti-Ragging N.G.O. S.A.V.E. Gaurav Singhal has also appeared at various media like T.V., FM and Newspapers over the last few years to spread awareness about the ragging issues. He was also invited to Aamir Khan's show Satyamev Jayate to highlight the ragging problem in India.

Shivam Yadav, a pharma graduate, contacted SAVE as a victim in 2013 during his college days and later started volunteering for SAVE. He provides counselling for ragging victims and works in the Victim Supports Team of SAVE and is instrumental in filing R.T.I.s to colleges and government authorities and monitoring the cases in National AntiRagging Helpline. 

We cordially invite you to the webinar, which commences 3:00 PM on October 10, Sunday. The talk will be streamed live on the YouTube channel of NSS BITS Pilani on the following link:

For the first time after the new normal in Pilani, the Department of Economics and Finance and EFA BITS Pilani brings you an “OFFLINE talk”!


Topic: Next Generation Core Banking Platforms

By 

Venu Madhav Miriyala

Senior Vice President, FIS India 

Economics and Computer Science - BITS Pilani, 1993 Batch

Core Banking Platforms are back-end systems that process banking transactions across the various branches of a bank. The system essentially includes deposit, loan, and credit processing. Among the integral core banking services are floating new accounts, servicing loans, calculating interests, processing deposits and withdrawals, and customer relationship management activities.

Core banking systems are aimed at empowering existing and probable customers to have greater freedom of their account transactions. With technological evolutions, transactions are now safer, faster, and less cumbersome. The fact that these transactions can be executed remotely, from any part of the world has made core banking systems a significant aspect of banking these days.

Venu Madhav Miriyala is a BITS Pilani alumnus from the batch of 1993   

He is currently the Senior Vice President at Fidelity Information Services. FIS is one of the world’s Largest Core Banking providers supporting the Core Processing Needs of 100’s of Banks across the world. Mr. Miriyala is leading the company's Global Next Generation Corebanking Engineering Centre.

He has spent more than 25 years in the Core Banking Domain working in many countries and was involved in engineering multiple Core banking Platforms from the ground up. His studies included courses in software engineering, functional programming, systems design, introduction to management science, and project management.

Join us on the 13th of October at 5 pm.

Coinciding with this auspicious occasion, Aadhaar is moving to the next decade of its existence, with a renewed objective to further improvise resident experience. To celebrate this occasion, UIDAI is hosting a Hackathon targeted at young innovators - who are still at various Engineering institutes and eager to step into the real world. The hackathon is starting on 28 Oct 21 at 0000Hrs and would continue till 31 Oct 21 up to 2300Hrs.

 

2. The Hackathon is organized under two broad themes - “Authentication reimagined” and “Enhanced enrolment experience”. Under these two broad themes, five problem statements have been curated by the Aadhaar team - which reflects a few of the challenges being faced by the residents. Detailed problem statements have been released at https://hackathon.uidai.gov.in. 

 

3. Out of 5 problem statements, teams may choose to solve any of the problems to confirm their participation. The solution must be innovative and must be backed by the demonstrable working code to address the challenge being faced by the residents.


4. Hackathon comes with rewarding cash prizes to celebrate the work of the winning team. Each theme carries the following cash rewards:-


First Prize
	

₹3,00,000

Second Prize
	

₹2,00,000

Third Prize

5.  In addition, the winning team members may get an opportunity to work with Aadhaar through campus placement to build the next-generation identity and authentication platform, subject to fulfillment of other terms and conditions.

 

So, come and participate in the first-ever Hackathon hosted by the UIDAI team. For further details and registration of the teams, please visit https://hackathon.uidai.gov.in. Hurry up as the registration is going to close on 25 Oct 21 at 2300Hrs.

Greetings from Kotak Education Foundation

Our organization, Kotak Education Foundation (KEF) was established in 2007 with a mission to address urban poverty through education & livelihood initiatives. KEF works in the impoverished areas of Mumbai - slums of Deonar, Govandi Chembur, Kurla, Dharavi, etc. to empower children and youth from the underprivileged families through various education and vocational skills training initiatives to make them employable and lead a life with dignity. KEF’s scholarship for meritorious students includes financial assistance, mentoring and coaching sessions to assist the 10th pass, complete 12th and graduation.

Dear Students, 

Tata Group for the first time has opened the doors of Tata Administrative Services (TAS), an IAS equivalent of the private sector via Tata Imagination Challenge to all the students across domains.

TAS, Tata Group's flagship leadership development program, was conceived by the legendary JRD Tata in 1956 as an elite service of young managers when he observed that there were people with impressive business acumen, but were limited by education or experience. Today the Tata Group has 30 companies in over 100+ countries and TAS Managers are leading it at every front and now they have opened their doors again to hire TAS Managers of batch 2022.

Link to Apply: https://dare2compete.com/competition/tata-imagination-challenge-2021-tata-sons-213975?refId=TICSuy

Eligibility: Every student enrolled in a full-time course across India and across domains - Engineering, Business, Arts, Commerce, Science, CA, etc. 

Apply now if you think you can be that leader who can take the Tata group to greater heights because the Tata group is more than a company and TAS is more than just a job.

Best,
Team TIC

Dear BITSian,

 

The teams at Alumni Relations, BITS Pilani and BITSAA International write to you with a grateful heart that is deeply indebted to you for your generosity and the incredible support you have shown to the Daily Wagers Campaign! 

 

It is with pride that we want to let you know the funds collected from the campaign have already been put to use - as promised - to support the daily wagers community on campuses with ration packages.

 

We are also happy to let you know that campuses are beginning to reopen, and already have the senior batches return to campus-life in September, slowly. The remaining batches will also return to their campuses over the next few weeks.

While that is good news for the daily wagers with their regular businesses slowly coming alive, BITSAA will continue to support them with the funds received, as previously decided, at least until December 2021, and will reassess the situation as things evolve with the pandemic. 

 

Any excess funds from this campaign will be redirected towards student scholarships. We’ll keep you posted on the updates from the campaign.

 

We also want to take a moment here and bring to your attention our ongoing fundraising campaigns, should you be feeling generous this festive season ✨

 

https://www.bitsaa.org/fundraising

 

Please feel free to reach out to the fundraising team should you have any questions regarding the campaign at all, they’d be happy to help!

Subject: PS-I 2021 Chronicles
From: "Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>

Dear All,
Greetings from Practice School Division.

Practice School-I (PS-I) is an integral part of the curriculum of BITS Pilani, offered to First Degree students at the end of their second year of the degree programme, during the summer. PS-I is an exposure-oriented course of an eight-week duration, the goal of which is to provide students an opportunity to observe how the workplace functions and help them apply the knowledge gained during their studies in the workplace. PS-I helps students nurture their professional, cognitive, and technical skills and host organizations by the enthusiastic participation and contribution of students to their ongoing work at their working premises.  PS-I is monitored and evaluated by a resident faculty, who conducts the program, in consultation with the host organization coordinator.  PS-I faculty is ably supported by student co-instructors and faculty co-instructors in operational and technical aspects, respectively.

Keeping the largest interest of wider knowledge dissemination, PSD is happy to bring forth the second edition of the PS-I Chronicles featuring over 1800 articles from PS-I students sharing their experiences during summer 2021. The basic premise behind the release of PS-I Chronicles is to document the PS-I learning experience of students keeping the below objectives in view.

1. To provide more information on the learning experiences by immediate senior students and PS-I faculty about stations, thereby enlightening the student community's learning opportunity.
2. To provide the faculty with enhanced information about the type and nature of work carried out at the organization.
3. To transform the knowledge gained at the organization into classroom teaching and identify the scope of deepening the collaborations with the organization.

The articles have been classified into five categories based on the industry domain.
Chronicle 1: Information Technology
Chronicle 2: Electronics
Chronicle 3: Chemical, Mechanical, Cement, Textile, Steel, and Infrastructure
Chronicle 4: Health Care and others
Chronicle 5: Finance and Management

PSD hopes that these PS-I chronicles will help every reader acknowledge the type of work done by students in PS-I and provide the necessary feedback path to bridge the industry-academia gap.

The chronicles are a must-read for prospective PS-I Students as this will help understand the work that is happening at various PS I Stations.  It will also help the student to identify his/her interest and hence enhance the scope of making an informed choice while filling the preference forms for PS-I.

The third edition of the PS-I chronicles is available at the following link:

Thank you
Prof. Gaikwad Anil Bhanudas

To: undisclosed-recipients:;
BCC: f20190579@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in

Greetings on behalf of SOVESA!

I hope you find this email in the pink of your health. It gives me immense pleasure to personally invite you to the 2nd part of our Discourse : Bhagavad Gita for Youth.


We were enthused to see active participation from the students in the 1st part of the Discourse and we are feeling extreme delight to again invite all the brilliant minds to take advantage of the jewel of the wisdom of Bhagavad Gita.    

 

Bhagavad Gita is said to contain Rāja-vidyā i.e. the highest of all knowledge and Rāja-guhyaṁ, i.e. the most confidential knowledge….

rāja-vidyā rāja-guhyaṁ

pavitram idam uttamam

pratyakṣāvagamaṁ dharmyaṁ

su-sukhaṁ kartum avyayam

This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed. (BG 9.2)

Thus, understanding the seriousness of the message of the Gita, we wish to lend a helping hand to all the genuine seekers of the Absolute Truth, to the ones who are in search of answers to the basic questions of life, and also to the ones, who want to experience a new dimension of life.

Course Objective:

Fundamental understanding of important verses in Bhagavad Gita for direct application in daily life.

Timeline:

Following is the session plan for Part 2 :

Session 1: 13 Nov

Session 2: 17 Nov

Session 3: 20 Nov

Session 4: 24 Nov

Session 5: 27 Nov

Session 6: 1 Dec

Session 7: 4 Dec

Session 8: 5 Dec, followed by a short exam

Pre-requisites:

No prerequisites. Expressed curiosity and open-mindedness is all that you need to understand Bhagavad Gita. Students from all years.

Course Rewards:

57 participants were rewarded for their active participation in the 1st part and we wish to see the same enthusiasm in the participants for the 2nd part as well. For this particular course, the rewards will be as follows:

    Certificate of Appreciation (for students who have scored more than 75% in the exam)

    Big Discount on Inception Camp to be organised in the month of January (for the students who have attended >= 7 sessions and scored more than 75% in the exam)


About the Camp:

To pacify the thirst of the intelligence that seeks an answer to the mystery of the Creation and Sustenance of the Universe, we have planned to organise a Spiritual Camp, INCEPTION, which aims at answering these unanswered questions not just in a dry, theoretical or philosophical way, but by practical experience.

Dates of the Camp : January 8th to January 13th, 2022

Venue : Jaipur

Special Highlights of the Camp:

1. A Trip to the Holy Land of Vrindavan

2. Exploring The Pink City, Jaipur 

3. Thrilling and Refreshing experience of Morning Program

4. Delicious Mouth watering Prasadam(Sattvik, Spiritual Food)

5. Discourse on Cosmology and the Creation of the Universe

6. Bonfire and Skit play

7. Special 1 to 1 interaction with Senior, Experienced Youth mentors

8. Gaushala Visit 

9. Extensive Discussions on Bhagavad Gita

and many more....

We request the interested ones to join this group (Please do NOT join this group if you are already present in our BG for Youth groups): https://bit.ly/BGFY_2

We hope to see an active participation from your end. And if you have any queries, doubts or suggestions, please feel free to get in touch.

Yours faithfully,

Greetings from APPCAIR!


The sixth talk of the APPCAIR Research Seminar series is scheduled as below:


Speaker: Dr. Venkatakrishnan Ramaswamy (BITS Hyderabad)

Title of the talk: "An Algorithmic Barrier to Neural Circuit Understanding"

Date: 11th November 2021 (Thursday)

Time: 04:00 PM 

Google Meet Link: https://meet.google.com/zne-mtqw-upa


Abstract of the talk: Neuroscience is witnessing extraordinary progress in experimental techniques, especially at the neural circuit level. These advances are largely aimed at enabling us to understand precisely how neural circuit computations mechanistically cause behaviour. Establishing this type of causal understanding will require multiple perturbational (e.g optogenetic) experiments. It has been unclear exactly how many such experiments are needed and how this number scales with the size of the nervous system in question. Here, using techniques from Theoretical Computer Science, we prove that establishing the most extensive notions of understanding need exponentially-many experiments in the number of neurons, in many cases, unless P = NP. Furthermore, using data and estimates, we demonstrate that the feasible experimental regime is typically one where the number of experiments one can perform scales sub-linearly in the number of neurons in typical nervous systems. This remarkable gulf between the worst-case and the feasible suggests an algorithmic barrier to such an understanding. Determining which notions of understanding are algorithmically tractable to establish in what contexts, thus, becomes an important new direction for investigation.  will also close with some speculation on if similar results might be true of sufficiently complex AI systems.

(No prior Neuroscience background will be assumed for the talk.)
