Bell peppers are full of good stuff! Like citrus, bell pepper has a ton of vitamin C. This powerful little vitamin is really important for the immune system because:

Dear students,

I hope you are well and safe at your home.

You can view your answer scripts of the evaluative assignment by tomorrow 20.6.2020. Your tutorial instructor will return it to you around 10.30 AM. The following marking policy is adopted for the correction:

 Questions 2, 4, 6, 8, 15 are evaluated for 6 marks each and in case if one of the questions among these is not attempted then Q7 is evaluated for 5 marks.

 Marking scheme for the above mentioned questions are attached. Go through it carefully. In case,  if you have any recheck request, then you can submit it, before 11.00 AM of 21.06.2020  to your tutorial instructor through bits-mail id only with proper justification. No recheck request will be entertained after that. You will be able to see information regarding recheck in the box given for private comments in google classroom.


With Best Regards,

Jitender

Learner Outcome
“I stated on my CV that I had experience in regression modelling and cluster analysis, could code in R and SAS, and had trained younger staff - almost all of this was as a direct result of the Coursera courses I’d taken. A week later an agency called and said they’d love to take me on with a flexible schedule and for more than double my previous salary.”

Subject: Apply today for the Yale School of Public Health Climate Change and Health certificate program
From: "Yale University" <no-reply@m.mail.coursera.org>
Date: 25-08-2020, 05:48
To: "ASWIN BENEDICT" <f20190579@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>

Dear ASWIN BENEDICT,

The Yale School of Public Health invites you to apply to their innovative online certificate program in Climate Change and Health. This 18-week program is designed to equip you with the knowledge and proven strategies needed to increase your community’s resilience to the adverse health impacts of climate change. Following completion of the program, you will be able to:

1. Describe how climate change adversely impacts human health across various populations.

2. Plan for and enact adaptation actions that build resilience to climate change’s negative health impacts.

3. Communicate effectively about the health effects of climate change to the public and policymakers and influence changes in climate-related health behavior.

The program gives you access to live weekly discussions with your peers and expert faculty, our global alumni network, and is eligible for CME and CPH credits. The next offering begins September 8th and the deadline to apply is quickly approaching. Apply by August 31 and learn more today!

Here are some of the things that alumni have said about the program:

“The program provides a wonderful introduction to the topic and tools for making an effective contribution through helping people understand climate change and take action to protect their own health and that of the planet. The instructors and teaching assistants are experts in the field.” – Terri Ballard, DrPH, Epidemiologist, Montebuono, Rieti, Italy

“Not only do you learn what you can do to help climate change mitigation or adaptation, you learn how to communicate this to others effectively in order to get more people engaged with the issue.” – Johnnie Yates, M.D., Family Physician, Honolulu

“The course has made me a stronger, more convincing advocate for addressing climate change. I feel I have improved capacity to communicate about the issues more effectively. The live sessions also helped me learn more about what other communities are currently dealing with, as other students shared what they are experiencing where they live.” – Maureen Gates, Los Angeles County Dept of Health Services

Thank you,

Yale Digital Education

Research Internship at NUS - An Intern's Experience
  	
   
Research Internship


Dear Customer,

 

Greetings from Corporate Gurukul Singapore!

This week we are delighted to share with you the various aspects of ‘research internship’ in particular at NUS.

Siddharth, a student from SRM University, India who went through the internship, covers aspects of both machine learning and deep learning and highlights the business aspects of real-world problem solving. The blog outlines the methods and ways in which a person can use different deep learning models and techniques such as ‘transfer learning’ to aid in their projects.

This is explained with a brief introduction and explanation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that was used to create a project revolving around the detection of facial expressions and their analysis which further sheds light on the current mental state of the person. Though not a very accurate measure, it has numerous practical uses ranging from classrooms for preschool children to packed stores for the analysis of how people react to the release of a new product.

Let us know your feedback!😊

Research Projects


Dear Customer,

 

Greetings from Corporate Gurukul Singapore!

This week we share with you yet another experience on how a research project helped our Intern to secure his masters admission in a world-class university abroad.

Aditya is currently pursuing his Masters in Computing at National University of Singapore (NUS). The article talks about the importance of research and how it can do wonders for you, especially if you plan on applying to the best universities out there. Further, basics on how to go about research internships and what the admission's office of international universities look at in a student’s profile has also been discussed. This gives you an edge over your peers and helps you secure that university seat which you have been longing for all this while.

Searching Partners for Building and Managing a Startup
Hello! Fellow Batchmates

I am a 2019 batch single degree student who is planning to create a start-up. The startup basically requires app and web development (I cannot disclose more details right now).Let me tell you that I have not proceeded much ahead in this journey as I wish to go ahead along with 3/4 proficient people who are passionate to manage the Startup with me. I am looking for competent and enthusiastic 2019 Batch people with the two below mentioned qualities whom I can make my business partners:

1. Knowledge of Operations, Marketing and Finance- Do note that you need not have expertise in these fields. A little bit knowledge with great zeal to learn and run a startup will also work. It is very much essential for management of the company.
2. Knowledge of App/Web Development- The main purpose for this is not to only develop the application, but also to supervise and lead the work of the App and web development team as I do not have any knowledge of Coding and I would prefer a knowledgeable person to lead the team.

So if you have any (or both) of the above mentioned criteria, then please fill this google form by 20th November.

You will get to know more about the venture and other things after you show your interest and fill the form.

Subject: Join Yale's newest course: Global Quality Maternal and Newborn Care
From: "Yale University" <no-reply@m.mail.coursera.org>
Date: 10-11-2020, 07:58
To: "ASWIN BENEDICT" <f20190579@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>

According to the World Health Organization, about 295,000 women died during and following pregnancy and childbirth in 2017. We know that the majority of these deaths are preventable.  While progress has been made, significant disparities still exist and the rate of death and disability remains unacceptably high in many countries and communities.

Yale’s newest online course, Global Quality Maternal and Newborn Care, is designed to provide the tools, background, and recommendations you need to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality in your own setting. In particular, you will learn about the evidence behind implementing the midwifery model of care as a means to advancing the health and wellbeing of mothers and babies globally.

Anyone who wants to see maternal and newborn outcomes improved globally or in their own community—health administrators, policy makers, clinicians, advocates—is invited to take this course to address these issues.

You may also be interested in other Yale offerings, particularly during this global pandemic:

    Boost your mental health with The Science of Well-Being

    Spot misinformation in the news with Understanding Medical Research

    Understand public health fundamentals with Essentials of Global Health

Dear Customer,

 

Greetings from Corporate Gurukul Singapore!

"Humankind is finding ways to get productive, digitally. The pandemic and its aftereffects are likely to last even after COVID is restrained, leading to a “new normal”, that is,  people will be compelled to remain socially distant due to the fear psychosis. However using technologies like Augmented Reality, will bridge the gap between the people and the businesses."


Shrisha Wagle, a graduate from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad in Master of Computer Engineering, who is currently working as a Software Engineer in the Cloud & Cognitive Software business unit at IBM India Software Labs.

Let us find out from her about how Augmented Reality can fit in and become the new normal!

Data Visualization: A Skill of The Future
Data Visualization is the art of representing data in the form of charts and graphics. Visual representations of data allow you to better understand data’s underlying pattern.

Dear Customer,

 

Greetings from Corporate Gurukul Singapore!

In the age of Big Data, Visualization plays a very vital role in understanding and making sense of the large datasets. The visuals tell us a story by highlighting the trends and outliers, separating the noise from useful data, and presenting the results of our analysis in a simple but powerful way. In Data Science, data visualization is a key part of Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Mining, and presenting the results of a model. 

Although underplayed, this tool is a must in every data scientist and ML engineer’s ever-growing toolkit.

The comfort offered by a car can’t be judged based on its form factor, but if we have to answer this question keeping majority of the cars in mind, then the answer would be a Sedan.

Abhishek


Dear Customer,

 

Greetings from Corporate Gurukul Singapore!

How to kickstart a career in cybersecurity? What are the basic skills required to bag a job in a cybersecurity company?


This was the question that came to my mind when I aspired to get into a Cybersecurity company with an internship experience of 6 months. 

Being a fresher to cybersecurity, I went through a lot of blogs, videos, and courses to understand cybersecurity which helped me to crack the interview at a leading cybersecurity firm about which I have discussed in this blog.

Ancient Craft Meets Modern Technique
Learn how one master luthier made her love of guitar-making into her own, creative process
Click here to view this email in your web browser.
Autodesk
ANCIENT CRAFT MEETS MODERN TECHNIQUE
Hi Aswin,
Making comes from the heart. That’s what we learned from master luthier, Rachel Rosenkrantz, who used to walk by the French lutherie Atelier de Maurice Dupont every day on her way to school observing the ancient craft of guitar making. See how she uses computer aided design to make her dreams into reality.
Read more
Design, Craft, & Music
As a design student, Rachel Rosenkrantz paid close attention to disciplines where she could combine all three of her passions – design, craft, and music.
Modern Design & Manufacturing
Rachel sketches her designs and then uses 3D modeling to double-check her work before 3D printing it. The additive manufacturing process offers her ample opportunities to play around with designs that would otherwise be impossible to make.
Creativity in Design
According to this master luthier, design doesn’t have rules. It has principles. Deciding how to put those principles to use with computer aided design is the fun part.

Technology has changed the traditional warehouse management system by altering the way companies send and receive orders. Traditional systems can be problematic because as a company’s volume order increases, the system of receiving and distributing orders becomes more complex.

Launching IdeaHunt
Written by Mayank Singh ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌
		
	
Launching IdeaHunt
Written by Mayank Singh
Jul 7		Comment	Share

We'll be honest, IdeaHunt is inspired by Product Hunt, with one slight change, our focus being college students :)

And that's precisely how this came to fruition. Ideas arguably constitute an organisation’s most valuable assets. Businesses and individuals are constantly searching for fresh, new ideas – the source of innovation. While some people believe that new ideas preserve brilliant minds, others argue that people's ability to find good innovative ideas is more about habits than intellect. 

If breakaway ideas come more accessible to those in the habit of looking for them, how can this habit be cultivated? And where do you find people with such ability? Yup, rightly guessed, Colleges! A place where you truly understand the essence of the free mind, a site that is a community of dreamers and doers. 

Having been in those exact shoes, the entire team knew the next step for college grads who come up with ideas in the middle of the night, "how do we validate the idea?" Idea validation is always painful for makers. We wanted to create a tool that eases this whole process.

There comes IdeaHunt. It takes crowdsourcing to a new level. People can vote for your idea, leave a comment to the creator, and start a conversation about the future product.
		

Jack Welch once said, "Someone, somewhere, has a better idea." We believe great ideas come to those who are in the habit of looking for great ideas all around them, all the time. Too often, people fall into the trap of thinking that the only worthwhile idea is a thoroughly original one. 

We understand that valuable ideas are already out there, waiting to be found - and not just in the usual places. Whether you are looking for your next product, a solution to a growth hurdle, need a new logo or creative ways to meet your goals, we are ready and waiting for you. 

What if you don't want to put an idea? Well, vote for the best ideas and give direct feedback to the creator. Help them create your next favourite thing.

Want to submit an idea? → IdeaHunt

Lastly, ping us anywhere! LinkedIn | Twitter | Facebook | Instagram

We are now Hallparty!  🎉

Hi,

We have a news for you. We are no longer Assist.

We loved being Assist, to be known as helpful, prompt and always there but some time back we felt that it missed the most important thing about college - all the fun.

We wanted our users to feel the vibes of a college party, hanging out with their friends, feeling the serendipity of hopping on in a room full of people. We wanted them to feel the evenings of ANC, and chai of VK Redi. Eating the pizza sandwich of Sky, drinking MNB at Blue Moon, early mornings at Nutan.

We wanted to bring back the memories of study sessions at the Library right before the Compres and the Prof Shows of Oasis. The liveliness of Bedrock and countless stories told by seniors. Gandhi 317. Ahem.

So we decided to change, and become just more of us, we decided to call ourselves Hallparty. Change is hard and often uncomfortable. Change needs friends. Hope you all would love Hallparty just as much as you loved Assist.

And we will continue to help you connect with your friends, interests, and communities all throughout the campus. 
Join Hallparty 🎉

As stated by our Chancellor, this intangible bond that ties all BITSians together is a truly magical bond that makes a BITSian go above and beyond to help other BITSians in need. We saw this at the numerous virtual networking sessions during BITSians’ Day and in the selfless contributions of Alumni towards the BITSAA COVID-19  Support initiatives.  

 

BITSians' Day App covering the city meet-ups, batch meet-ups and other featured events made this year even more special. The browser-based app offered a platform to access the venues and stay updated with the events and announcements seamlessly.

 

Thanks to tireless efforts from our BITSAA Volunteers, Chapter Leaders, and Batch Representatives, we were able to put together a host of programs and leave a global footprint yet again.

 

In the 72-hour long fest, we had

    Address by Mr. Kumar Mangalam Birla

    Fireside chat series - Red Hot Pixel Pepper, Tackling Mental Health - BITSian Startups 
    Featured Events - BITSian Startup Pitches, Talent Showcases
    Batch and university meet-ups in addition to city and company meet-ups
    A pan-Africa meet
    A pan-Latin America meet
    BITSians attending multiple events across the globe

 

BITSAA extends a heartfelt gratitude to our sponsors - Shobhitam and Beco - for making yet another BITSians’ Day a huge success!

 

In addition, we conducted two rewarded contests and are happy to announce the winners.

Trivia Contest

 

In this 3-day long contest, we hosted a fun BITS Trivia on the Quizizz platform. We thank Beco for sponsoring the prizes for this contest!

Photo Contest

 

In this 2-week long contest, we called out BITSians to upload a throwback treasure which depicted their BITSian journey in a click!

BITSAA congratulates all the winners and they will soon receive the prizes!

Design on Canva
	 
 

Tip 1
  	
Make it personal

Looking to add your own touch to a design? Easily upload images, videos, gifs, or audio, and customize them like any other element in Canva. It could be a logo for your business or a video of family and friends. Already have something uploaded online? Connect and grab content directly from your Google Drive, Dropbox, or social media accounts.
	 
  	Upload something 	 
 
 
 

Tip 2

Get creative with video
  	Adding video footage is a great way to create powerful, eye-catching, and memorable designs. Browse through our massive library of royalty-free clips, use them as a backdrop with text on top, or even stitch some together with our new video editor. The creative possibilities are endless. 	 
  	Browse videos 	 
 
 
 

Tip 3
  	
The power of music

A great piece of music really sets the mood for your work. It’s also a great way to add a personal element, using a style that reflects what you love. Whether you’re into Pop, Rock, Electronica, Classical, or a genre that you’ve just discovered, you’ll find inspiration in our audio section under the Elements tab.
	 
  	Add some audio

Cocreate Discontinuation
On October 1st, Gather will discontinue support for Cocreate whiteboards.
Gather Desktop Header

Hey there,

 

On October 1st, Gather will discontinue support for Cocreate whiteboards. Cocreate whiteboards may be found in older Gather Spaces (created before April 2021).

 

If you have data stored on a Cocreate whiteboard that you don't want to lose, please save your whiteboard's contents as an .svg file using Cocreate's built-in tool.
Screen Shot 2021-09-02 at 11.31.29 AM

After our support ends, interacting with a Cocreate whiteboard will result in an error message. You can erase these whiteboard objects from your Space like any other object. Placing new whiteboards in your spaces will create whiteboards powered by Eraser.

 

To keep up with the latest news, updates, and other new features, check out our public changelog!

Your JEE Result Doesn't Matter.

In this episode of the CNTC (Cup Noodles To Career) Show,  we talked to Ishan Sharma (2019 Admitted, BITS GOA Campus) on how he founded MarkitUp alongside his college and how he managed regular content creation - gaining over 100,000 followers in the last 3-months alone!

 

This episode talks a lot about Content Creation, Entrepreneurship, and MarkitUp's journey. After IIT-JEE Results came out in 2019, his IIT Dream was shattered and from that disappointment to founding his own company in college and hitting 200k+ Subscribers on Youtube in just one year - he is a true inspiration to countless students. A lot to learn from his story. I am sure you’ll be inspired from this one!

We welcome you to nominate worthy candidates, and also self nominate yourself if you fit into any criteria.

There's something special about the sound a German car door makes when you close it.
 ‌ ‌ ‌ 
Notion

Hi there,

There's something special about the sound a German car door makes when you close it. A good, solid thud — a feeling of quality and craftsmanship. So when our engineers are prototyping new Notion features, we often ask each other "Does this meet our quality bar? Does it feel like a German car door?"

In Notion 2.12, we took a few core features like comments & public pages, and simply made them better. More solid. Here are a few of those improvements:

(1) Set a home page for your public site

Hosting your blog, resumé or portfolio on a public Notion page? If you have a paid plan, now you can set a public home page in Settings & members → Settings. Share a short and customized URL (acmedesign.notion.site, for example) that takes folks straight to your home page.

A cursor selects the URL bar in a Safari browser window and types acmedesignnotionsite then the browser shows the public Notion page at that address

Learn more about public pages →

(2) New emojis and other mini-features

Sometimes the best gifts come in the smallest packages. Over the last few weeks, we added several mini-features and quality of life improvements to Notion, all based on your feedback. Here are a few of our favorites:

    Dozens of new emojis & page icons
    Include dynamic @today & @me mentions in database templates & template buttons
    Copy & paste multi-column layouts

A slideshow of Notion pages with titles cover images and a selection of new emojis as page icons including bubble tea tamale transgender flag otter potted plant and more

See more updates →

(3) New comments sidebar

Collaborate with your friends, family members & classmates through a completely redesigned comments experience in Notion. Now you can see every comment on a page at a glance, and respond to any comment thread — all consolidated in your new right-hand sidebar.

A cursor clicks the new comment icon at the top right of the Notion desktop app which opens the new comments sidebar

Learn more about comments →

(4) Back to school

Any students or educators in your life that want to get organized? Is that person you? We have some exciting updates to share!

    We now offer discounted team plans for university groups and clubs! And the Personal Pro Plan is still 100% free for students and educators. Learn more →
    We gathered the best Notion templates for students and educators to organize everything in one place, so you can focus on getting the most out of school. Grab the templates →
    For students or anyone learning a new skill (especially coding students!), our friends at Codecademy put together this resources organizer to help you manage your online courses, books, and frequently referenced docs.

Notions desktop app is shown with a template from Codecademy - a database to organize resources for school

I hope these improvements make your Notion workspace feel more useful, and more solid. Wishing you a productive rest of your week.

Warmly,

Ivan

Co-founder & CEO

Thanks for your support
  	We’re excited to say that we now have 65 million people from 190 countries designing in Canva each month, who have created more than 7 billion designs. Our rapid growth wouldn’t have been possible without your support 🙏

We have some exciting news to share with our ‘two-step’ plan. But first, a massive thank you for: 	 

Joining Canva in

2021

It’s been great to get to know you this year 👋

Creating

7 designs!
  	Share your Canva journey with us on social #CanvaLove 	 
  	
		
		
	
	
		
		
	 

Without you, Canva wouldn’t be where we are today.
  	Since the beginning we’ve had a two-step plan: 	 
  		 
  	
1
	To build one of the world’s most valuable companies
	 
  	
2
	To do the most good we can do
	 
  	We’ve been trying to do both over the years: 	 
  	
bullet 	We now have more than 130,000 nonprofits on our Nonprofit Program (where we give away Canva Pro for free).
	 
  	
bullet 	Through our One Print, One Tree initiative where we plant a tree for every print order, so far, we’ve committed to planting more than 2 million trees.
	 
  	
bullet 	We’re part of the 1% Pledge where we have committed 1% of our profits, 1% of our product, 1% of our team’s time and 1% of our equity to be a force for good in the world.
	 
  	
bullet 	Through the company values that our team tries to live every day, “be a force for good”, “be a good human” and “empower others”.
	 
  		 
  	We’re excited to announce that we’ve made some great progress on both Step 1 and Step 2 in the past few weeks: 	 
  	
bullet 	Canva is now valued at $40 billion USD, thanks to some world-leading investors who want to support us on our mission to empower the world to design
	 
  	
bullet 	We have committed 30% of Canva’s value to be used as a force for good to contribute to the world
	 
  	
Read our Announcement
	  	
Read more from Forbes
	 
  	Our first project is with GiveDirectly, where $10 million will be given directly to the world’s poorest people in Southern Africa.

So that’s it. Just wanted to say a massive thank you for your contribution to Canva over the years, it’s greatly appreciated. We hope you feel proud of your contribution to both Step 1 and Step 2. We truly couldn’t do it without you.

We’ll try to live up to the mammoth responsibility over the years to come.

Dear BITSian,

 

To recognize and honor outstanding achievements of BITSians under the age of 30, we run the BITS 30 Under 30 awards every three years.

 

These awards are dedicated to all those young BITSians who thought and acted differently, challenged the status quo, rewrote the rules, and created their own paths, and are the best examples of what it means to be a BITSian.

The awards are open to all BITSian students & graduates from Pilani, Goa, Hyderabad, Dubai, and the Distance Learning programs. We will consider all achievements that took place before the nominee turned 30. All those who are born after January 1989 are eligible to apply.


We welcome you to nominate worthy candidates, and also self nominate yourself if you fit into any criteria.

 

An outstanding panel of BITSians who collectively represent excellence in Industry, Academia, Non-Profit and Arts, has been created to decide the winners. These names will be shared in due course.

 

The categories are here.

The nomination form is here.

Nominations are open till October 20, 2021.

 

We look forward to receiving your nominations.
Thank you

Jess’ lightbulb moment
  	After interning at a wish-granting organization, North Carolina local Jess Ekstrom saw kids were having a tough time after losing their hair during chemotherapy. She wondered whether something as simple as a headband could lift their spirits, and her business Headbands of Hope was born. For every headband sold, one is donated to a child with an illness - over one million have been donated to date. 	 
  		 
  	Today, Jess operates her business from the road, living and working in an Airstream with her husband and dog as they travel around the county. With Canva, Jess has the flexibility to create and collaborate remotely with her team, designing social media posts, videos, presentations, and thank you cards for sick children everywhere. Jess says Canva has been a “game-changer” for her business.
	 
  		 

“We hope each headband will serve as a reminder, when our customers wear them, that small acts of kindness can make a huge impact.”
  		 
  	So if you’ve got an idea, sometimes all you need is a spark of inspiration to bring it to life. Explore our massive library of templates and see if it lights a fire within you?
	 
  	Find your spark 	 
 
 

Advice from Jess
  	
1
	Start now.
“You’re never going to be ready, so you might as well just start when you’re inspired.”
	 
  	
2
	Stay focused.
“Take one step at a time. Thinking of the big things you want to do long term can distract you from what needs to be done now.”
	 
  	
3
	Back yourself.
“Don’t be afraid to fail. One of the biggest lessons I’ve learnt is that nobody knows what they’re doing (at first).”
	 
  	Feeling inspired? All that’s left to do is make it happen. You can start by writing your business plan, creating a logo, or your first social media post - you’ll find everything you need to hit the ground running with Canva.
	 
  	Take the first step

Notion
Everybody has a to-do list. And there's no better feeling than crossing something off that list.
 ‌ ‌ ‌ 

Hi there,

Everybody has a to-do list. And regardless of how you keep track of all those tasks, the same principle remains true: if you're rigorous about prioritization, you can get more stuff done — and faster.

In Notion 2.13, we launched new database grouping tools to help you achieve exactly that: higher productivity through precise organization.

Try it out

    See your tasks grouped by priority in a minimalist List view, so you can stay focused on the most important items
    Group your tasks by urgency & sub-group your tasks by importance in Board view to decide which tasks to do first, and which to schedule for later
    Visualize your to-do list grouped by a Relation property connected to a goals tracker to make sure you're prioritizing the tasks that matter most


There's no better feeling than crossing something off your list. I hope that these new grouping features help you experience that feeling more often than you thought was possible.

Warmly,

Ivan

Co-founder & CEO

P.S. We are looking for lots of software engineers, recruiters, sales folks & more. Know anyone?

Subject: Events on Gather just got way better

Events on Gather just got way better
Next time you host an event on Gather, you'll see some new things that we think you'll like. Enjoy!
Gather logo

Today we're excited to unveil an entirely revamped pre-event experience! We've dramatically simplified how easy it is to host any event on Gather, whether it's conferences, parties, workshops, networking sessions, or socials. We believe this is a huge step up in event quality and overall Gather experience, and we can't wait for you to see for yourself!
  	  	 

📝 Event Onboarding Flow

From your Gather homepage, you now have an Events tab to showcase all your upcoming events. From Events, select Create Event to jump into our new onboarding flow. 

 

Alternatively, from our Get Started page select Create Space and then Events to access our new onboarding.
A screenshot of the new Gather Events tab available from your Gather homepage. Two events are previewed: Halloweenie Roast, with an image of a fire at night in Gather, and the second Virtual Thanksgiving, with a preview of a large dinner table in Gather. In the Top Nav Menu, a Create Event button displays in the top right corner.
  	  	 

✔️ Host Dashboard and Checklist

We're super excited to now offer event hosts a centralized dashboard that allows you to track progress toward creating and ultimately publishing your event. With a streamlined step-by-step checklist, event management in Gather is now easier than ever. (Keep in mind, an event ≠ reservation. If you'd like to turn your free event into a reservation for 25 or more guests, make sure you go to your dashboard in Step 4 to make a reservation!)
A screenshot of the Events checklist page. Three of the four steps are complete, which is indicated by a progress bar at the top. The Steps are 1, Basic Info; 2, Landing Page; 3, Space Creation; and 4, Space Dashboard. In Step 3, a preview of the Moon pond template in Gather displays.
Take me to Gather
  	  	 

🛬 Event Landing Pages

The event attendee experience is also about to improve dramatically! Events now come with custom landing pages, complete with event details and the ability to join, save, share, and add events to your personal calendar.

 

We also created a set of instructions geared toward new users that will always display on the landing page. Now everyone can come to the event familiar with the basics and equipped with the right tools! 
A screenshot of the Events landing page. An image preview shows the silhoutte of a man walking down a street full of neon signs. The Event text to the right of the image lists the event title, the date and time of the event, buttons to Add to Calendar, Share, or Save, and a button to Join Event. Further down is a block of text under Event Details, followed by a section titled
  	  	 

📢 Information Board

You can now pin messages on an Information Board if you are a Moderator or Owner (with the exception of remote work Spaces; see more details in our Help Center). Keep your eye out for live announcements, which will let you broadcast real-time notifications to the entire Space. Coming soon!
A screenshot of the large game room template in Gather. In the Left Nav Menu, the pushpin icon is outlined in red, and the Information Board is showing the Pinned Messages section. There is no current pinned message.
