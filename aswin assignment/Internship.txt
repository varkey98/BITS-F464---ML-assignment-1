Greetings from CEL, BITS Pilani! 


We are glad to share with you an internship opportunity at Spyne. Here is a brief description for the same:

************************** 

Spyne is a platform that helps businesses access high-quality visual content. We are building a niche AI solution that can auto edit images at scale. For example, imagine AirBnB or Amazon or Flipkart run millions of their images through Spyne - and receive high quality, auto edited, and ready to use images. The AI auto edits all the images intelligently by understanding diverse image categories and the subjective editing required on each of the categories. We are backed by some of the top names in the Indian Investment community, including the CXOs and Founders of leading Internet companies.


We at Spyne are hiring across roles in Computer Vision if you want to be part of the lab that builds the most commercial yet sophisticated business solutions.


Computer vision tech today is at the stage where rockstars can come together and build amazing business solutions.

Exactly the same trajectory path as what Mobile Apps were 10 years ago. Obviously, the work we do today will democratize technology but before that, it will allow the world to change how we see things figuratively and literally.


Join us on our journey. Apply now! 


For any queries, reach out directly to Vaibhav(+91 98110 36500), Head of Products @Spyne.

Hi ASWIN,

Congratulations on making your first application on Internshala. We are happy to have you onboard with us!

Let's first get you acquainted to some of the basic and important guidelines to be followed on Internshala-

    Applying to internships and jobs on Internshala is always free. You DO NOT have to pay anything in order to secure an internship or a job through us.
    Please Note: If an organization asks you to pay a security deposit or a fee for the internship or job then, please bring this to our attention by visiting the Help Center, so that we can look into it and take necessary actions.
    Please do not accept the internship or job (except NGOs or Campus Ambassador programs) if you are directly hired (without an interview or submitting an assignment) for it. The general process is that the employer takes an interview or gives an assignment. And, on the basis of your performance in that, you are selected or proceed to the next round of interview. If you do get hired directly then, please bring it to our notice by dropping a query from the Help Center.
    Always ask for an offer letter or an email that confirms your hiring and mentions the terms and conditions of internship or job from the employer before you start. In a campus ambassador program, generally, employers do not give an offer letter. In this case, if you receive an email with all the details of the program, then that works as well.

Great! You're all caught up now and have familiarised yourself with the general community guidelines. To read the guidelines in detail, click here.

Now, as your application has been shared with the employer, you must be wondering about the next steps. For that, you need to wait for a few days. If the employer likes your application, he/she will get in touch with you within 1-2 weeks and give you further details regarding the internship. You can also check your application status by logging into your Internshala account.

Tip - In case you do not get any response or a status update regarding your application from the employer within 1-2 weeks of applying and your application status remains 'Applied', 'Seen' or 'Under Review' then, it is best that you apply for various other internships and/or jobs that are available on the platform. You may also go through this article to know how you can improve your applications which will, in turn, increase your chances of getting hired.
All the very best!

Subject: PS-1 Talk Recording | PMP BITS Pilani

Greetings from PMP BITS Pilani.

We hope this email finds you well. 

PS-1 is pivotal for BITSians since it gives them the first-hand experience of working in the real world. A lot of information about the stations, the CGPA cut-offs, etc. is circulated. This information is sometimes ambiguous, leaving the sophomore students confused, especially while filling their preference form.
In view of the above, PMP organized an interactive session, for 2019-batch students, which addressed some of the FAQs about PS-1. Seniors of the 2018 batch in different domains (IT, Core, Finance, etc.) talked about how they filled out the preference form, dealt with clashing interests of PS stations, post allotment evaluations, their overall experience, and any shortcomings they may have faced. 

If you missed out on attending the talk, or just need a refresher, we’ve got your back!!

As the process of filling out the preference form for PS-1 nears, we figured there may still be some unanswered questions regarding it all. PFA the recording of the event/Click on the link given below to access the recording of the event.

Youtube Link 
(Note: In the interest of time and approaching comprehensive examinations, it is advised to watch the video chapter-wise, and if you have the time, you can watch the entire 2hr recording as well.) Also, find attached the slides used in the presentation.

Stay home!! Stay safe!!

Students can schedule a 1-1 call with a mentor of their choice to get help on:
1. Job applications
2. Resume reviews
3. Mock Interviews
4. Thesis/ Research Internship applications
5. MBA applications
6. GMAT/ GRE Prep

This is regarding the previous mail titled  "Placement & Internship Webinar | Profile Building Session | BYJU's Co Founder" 

After sending the mail, we received some information and feedback from the previous year's students who had signed up for BYJU's CareerLabs after attending the webinar last year. 

A lot of students reported cases of fraud and cheating. The event has been called off from our end until they resolve the previous year's students' issue and take active steps to ensure they provide the best experience for all students from BITS Pilani.  

All the students are advised not to attend it.

"I will turn my dreams into goals. I will turn my goals into steps. I will turn my steps into actions. And through my actions I will achieve what I wish to"

Dear Student, 

Has it ever happened that you wanted to learn something and found yourself stuck at finding the right path? Have seniors told you too often to explore things but you've wondered how? Do you think to yourself how many IT companies are open for your branch in the internship season?

You're not alone. We've all been there. We believe till the time you are determined to give your best, unawareness, lack of resources and lack of guidance should never hinder you.

Hence we are building Project Expository.

Project Expository is an initiative under the Placement Unit that aims at creating guidance pathways for students. It aims at solving 4 major issues- 

1) Awareness on various careers opportunities via exciting podcasts with amazing BITSian seniors

2) Well curated learning pathways and resources for learners across disciplines like IT, Product, Finance etc.

3) Data backed insights from the PU to facilitate better decision making

4) Learning resources from leading colleges of India along with other exciting fields like competitions and challenges, CVs, off-campus opportunities

It is a campus wide initiative built on the experiences, learnings and data of the Placement Unit to help students gear up for all kinds of future opportunities.

The Beta Version for Expository shall be available on an invite only basis. Fill out the google form before 8th August, 2021 to confirm your invitation.

P.S. Project Expository is the team that built Summer Analytics Course - ABC. We are now set on our new journey to change the way BITSians perceive learning, awareness and information sharing. For clubs/organisations looking to become co-creators in our journey, please do reach out. Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.

For any queries/suggestions please feel free to reach out to:

From 10 Lakh in 2019 to 6.5 Lakh in 2021, what is the reason behind the drop in JEE Main registrations?

JEE Mains, one of the toughest exams in India, has been the soul of engineering students to get into indigenous world-ranked technical institutions. Students are more likely to opt for regional engineering tests than JEE. In a nation that produces more than 1 million engineering graduates annually, it is difficult to believe in the sudden unlikeliness towards JEE.

Dear Students,
It is nice to get in touch with you again for technology solutions to a societal cause. Responses from you were overwhelming and we have already submitted three projects for possible funding with students' participation. Now, there is another opportunity to demonstrate your skill to develop a technology solution for a social cause. I may invite new students who are not part of earlier project proposals if they are interested. I already have some ideas in this regard. We will discuss once the group is finalised. Please send me email if you are keen to be a part of the project along with your ideas related to this topic by 31 July 2021.
Wish you all the best

Dear Sir/Maám,

 

Greetings from Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF)!

 

The Indo-US Science and Technology Forum would like to invite you for the Solar Decathlon India 2021-22 challenge.  

 

Solar Decathlon India is a challenge for students to learn and design net-zero energy-water and climate resilient buildings. They partner with real estate developers and the industry and work on live building projects.

 

In the first year’s challenge, students from over 103 institutions across India participated in the challenge and gained foundational knowledge about building science and climate responsive design. Several students from the finalist teams were able to get placements and internships through our Career Connections session and kick-start their careers in sustainability towards combating climate change.  This year, these opportunities will increase and become stronger.

 

We hope you can share this information with your students who can join this initiative to create innovative solutions for net-zero buildings. Click here to register.

 

Feel free to pass on the message to others in your networks who can participate as Student Teams, Project Partners or Industry Partners in the 2021-22 Challenge. 

 

Here are some links that you can refer to:

·  The 2021-22 challenge website 

·  Promotional video of the 2021-22 Challenge

·  A summary video of last year's challenge

Dear Students, 

Understanding the high demand of Jobsy Mentorship Program and constraints with mentor availability, we have come up with following structures in order to accommodate all the students: 

1. Luxon: 
Batch will be starting from 3 August 2021 (Tuesday). 
Timings: 7:30 PM - 8:30 PM 
Eligibility: ALL the students graduating in 2022 and 2023. 

Note: It doesn't matter which semester you are appearing for PS-2 or placements in. You can participate in the Luxon program as long as you are graduating in 2022/ 2023. 

2. Tachyon: 
Batch will be starting from 3 August 2021 (Tuesday). 
Timings: 9 PM - 10 PM 
Eligibility: Only the students graduating in 2022 and not having PS-II in Semester-1 (i.e. not enrolled in PS-II between July 2021 to December 2021)  and ALL the students graduating in 2023. 

Note: For the students graduating in 2022 and having a PS-II in Semester-1 (i.e. enrolled in PS-II between July 2021 to December 2021) we will be starting another batch of Tachyon shortly which will either run on weekends or be from 10-11 PM as popularly requested. Final details about this batch will be communicated before 7th August 2021. 

3. Photon: The batch will be starting post 4 August 2021 as we are still figuring out the logistics with the mentors. Kindly be patient. You will receive more details about the batch very shortly. We are working actively on it. 

To register your interest, as the second last step, please fill this form by 3 PM, 2 August 2021 positively. 

Deadline won't be extended at any cost. 

After you fill the form, you will receive a registration link accordingly for Tachyon and Luxon batches. 

Photon students must fill the form as well though, since further information will be communicated to only the students who would have filled the form. 

NOTE:
1. It takes a lot of backend efforts and mapping to match students with mentors. Our aim is to accommodate EVERYBODY. So please be patient and fill the form responsibly. 
2. Attending classes of the batch for which you register is COMPULSORY. In case you miss more than 2 classes, you will be charged Placement Penalty Points. 
3. It is not possible to change time or introduce more flexibility. The sessions are to be mapped with mentor availability as well. So kindly cooperate.

Greetings from CEL, BITS Pilani! 

We are glad to share with you an internship opportunity at Hoist. Here is a brief description for the same:

************************** 

Hoist is an asynchronous video management solution for creators and small businesses. We've just shipped the first version of the product,

which allows users to easily collect video testimonials from their customers and share them on their website and social channels.

Over the next few months, as we go to market and get feedback from our early users, we will need to rapidly iterate on the product and

prepare for scale. From a technical standpoint, this will involve -

    designing and building new features
    expanding the tech stack as needed (current stack - NextJS, Firebase)
    integrating with other applications our users use
    setting up building blocks for analytics and tracking

About this role
This is a paid internship position for 1-2 full-stack engineers for ~3 months. You will work closely with the founder on the above problem statements.
Based on your skill set and interests, we can figure out a sharper definition of projects and expected outcomes.

Location - remote
Hours - preferably full-time but open to part-time as well.

This role is a good fit for someone who can operate independently and hit the ground running.
We can promise high-quality engineering work and good overall exposure to other aspects of early growth,
including customer support, community building & content marketing. As the company scales,
we will be looking to make full-time hires in the next 6 months, and our first preference would be to hire from our internship pool.

Requirements

    1-2 years experience with modern tools like React, NextJS, Node, ES6, Typescript, Redux, GraphQL, CSS in JS, Webpack, Babel
    Experience architecting, developing, and testing client-side code end to end
    Experience developing software for the Web, including cross-browser compatibility
    Effective communication

If interested, please apply through AngelList or send an email to sanjeev@tryhoist.com

From: "Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>

Greetings from Project Expository!

With the recent surge of opportunities and hence the subsequent inclination of undergrad students for non-core opportunities like consulting and product management, there has been a significant drop in the number of students considering the core engineering domains as prospective career options. The attention that these fields get is plummeting and there is also a dearth of awareness about the core domains, the placement process, profile building and other aspects.

Project Expository plans to tackle these issues by organizing podcasts of students who have chosen to go the “core” way and have bagged some of the biggest job opportunities in their respective domains. The podcasts will include them talking about their resume building, projects, internships, interview process and preparation in general.

These podcasts will be uploaded on Expository and will be accessible for all. We request you to kindly fill out this google form to put in your queries regarding core placements, preparation, profile/CV building among others.

For any further queries/suggestions about Expository, feel free to reach out to:

Manasvi Singh (+918860074510)

Dear Students, 

Greetings from the Placement Unit!

In the finance world, two common designations are the CFA Charter and FRM Certification. If you’re thinking about becoming a financial analyst or working with investments, these are the two designations that could advance your career. Making the right choice is important because each of the examinations takes a lot of hard work, money, and of course, a lot of time. Keeping that in mind, Finance Committee presents to you The CFA-FRM Talk. The talk is scheduled for 15th August (Sunday) at 12 PM.

Our speakers are: 

    Raaj Dhanwani (Batch of 2017, M.Sc. Economics + B.E. Mechanical Engineering). He has cleared his CFA Level 1 and is currently an Equity Research Intern at Credit Suisse.
    Tarun Upadhyay (Batch of 2014, M.Sc. Economics + B.E. Mechanical Engineering). He has cleared his FRM Level 1 and is working full-time at Credit Suisse.

                      
Overview of the talk:
The talk will cover the following points in detail:

    What is CFA/FRM? CFA vs FRM - How to choose?
    Why and when you should pursue CFA/FRM?
    How can you prepare for each of these exams?


See for yourself the coming together of CFA and FRM in one room, and decide for yourself. Is it CFA or FRM for you…. or both?  

Please join the session using this link. You can submit any queries for the speakers here.

For more information and queries, join our slack channel.

For any doubts, you may contact -

Dear Students,

The Finance Committee aims at inculcating a strong Finance Culture in the students of BITS Pilani and ensuring the best finance placements, internships, informative sessions, interview preparation, workshops, simulation of portfolio allocation etc.

CFA and FRM are two of the most coveted certifications in the field of finance, and in order to understand both the examinations from a perspective tailor-made for BITSians, the Finance Committee had organized a session on the topic. The recording of the session can be accessed through this link and the slides used in the presentation can be accessed by clicking here.

During the talk, we also had a discussion around the introduction of an additional level in CFA (Level 4). Because it is a fairly new addition, we couldn't dive deep into the topic at that time. We have attached a video for your reference which will help you gain a better understanding.

Since a lot of students have questions about the finance courses offered by the institute, while choosing their electives for the term, we have compiled the course overview drive, a collection of short presentations that give a bird's eye view of the popular finance courses that are offered. The slides contain information about what's taught in the courses, what's their relevance, and how to ace them. We hope that this will help you in selecting the right courses for the upcoming semester.

The course material drive is a one-stop destination for all previous year papers and other resources that will supplement your academic efforts through the semester for finance courses.

Dear Sudhir, 

I hope you are well.

I am sure you have been receiving formal invitations to join us at Bridge: Connecting the Futures of Work and Education, Harappa's inaugural annual conference, being held this week on August 18-19, 2021 from 2.30-7.30 PM IST. I am writing to invite you personally to register and/or nominate someone from your institution to attend this exclusive, by-invite-only event. 

As you may already know, Harappa Education is a first-of-its-kind online learning institution which aims to help professionals build THRIVE skills—core social, cognitive, and behavioral skills—that are critical for career success through online courses and blended learning programs. 

Our conference Bridge has been envisioned with a goal to ignite and foster crucial conversations between academia and industry on our talent needs for the future. It will bring together on a single platform, India’s top academics, global education experts, industry talent leaders, and C-suite members, something that has never been done before!

We have an exciting line-up of speakers which includes Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman of the industrial conglomerate Aditya Birla Group; Laxman Narasimhan, Global Chief Executive Officer, Reckitt Benckiser Group; Chris Dede, Professor in Learning Technologies at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and a thought leader in the field of lifelong learning; and Julie Dirksen, author of the best-selling book Design for How People Learn. We have also selectively picked out topics like 'The New Age Resume'; 'Reimagining Faculty'; 'Do Internships Matter?'; and 'Preparing Gen-Z and Gen-Alpha' for discussions which will be held in 6 different formats!

This is the very first time that both educators and recruiters will come together to address the crucial issue of the employability gap and I really hope you can engage with at least a few sessions. You can check out the agenda and request your invitation here. 

I look forward to having you join us! 

Warmly, 
Pramath Raj Sinha
Founder and Chairman, Harappa Education

Dear Students 

Greetings from The FIRP (Forum of International Relations and Public Policy), BITS Pilani Goa campus. We would like to thank all of you for an overwhelming response to our Special Lecture on 'International Careers for Young Indians' with the speaker, Ms. Akshaya Shivkumar (World Bank, Washington DC). 

We are excited to announce the confirmation of our Public Policy research project in the PetCare domain in association with Zibatech Wellness Pvt. Ltd, a startup by IIT Delhi alumni. Apply Now using the link  https://forms.gle/2dg6n8VMZWHQQSve6

The details of the project are as follows:

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been multiple incidents in the media wherein we observed that there was a huge influx of people who adopted pets during the lockdown. But the downside to that was the number of animals being abandoned on streets also increased manifolds.

Seeing and observing these trends, The FIRP (Forum of International Relations and Public Policy), BITS Pilani Goa (https://www.facebook.com/ThefirpBITSGoa) in collaboration with an IITD alumni startup, Zibatech Wellness Pvt. Ltd (https://www.zibatechs.com/our-initiatives), has launched a program where we are working on a research project to identify major policy decisions that may help to stop these incidences of abandonment and are collecting a database of all the pet owners in India for making a community where we can help people struggling in taking care of their pets by finding new parents for their pets within that community.

This is a callout for any interested volunteers who want to help us in this journey of ours.

All the interns cum volunteers will receive the following incentives:
1. Co-endorsed Internship Completion Certificate from The FIRP and Zibatech Wellness Pvt. Ltd.
2. Letter of Recommendation and Appreciation endorsed by alumni from IIT Delhi and BITS Pilani for top 15 volunteers
3. A honorarium of rupees 1000 INR and goodies from Zibatech Wellness for the top-performing volunteers (depends on your performance)

Kind Regards,
The FIRP (Forum of International Relations and Public Policy), BITS Pilani Goa Campus

Greetings from CEL, BITS Pilani! 

 

We are glad to share with you an internship opportunity at Utilize. Here is a brief description for the same:


************************** 

At utilize.app, we make no-code tools for businesses to scale without a technical team. Each business operates differently and requires customized business apps to run efficiently. Since custom apps are costly to build, they resort to complex ERPs, spreadsheets, or even pen-paper. Utilize solves this problem by creating a builder experience that makes software creation as easy as writing specifications. 

We are 2 co-founders (Ex BITS, Flipkart, Phonepe) and are looking for a product marketing intern to join us immediately on a remote basis. 

The internship is best suitable if you are looking to build a career in product or marketing or want to startup in your 20s. You can apply irrespective of your year. Bonus points if you have experience in writing content or doing marketing.

Responsibilities
1. Closely work with the founding team to iterate the product and establish a market fit
2. Reach out to new leads/potential customers through email & social media.
3. Create content for blogs and other required creatives to be shared in communities. 
4. Comprehend app requirements for onboarding new customers, deeply understand how the product works and help them build the apps.

Perks

    Monthly stipend
    Letter of Recommendation
    Flexible work hours 
    High learning curve

Please use this link to apply.

Greetings BITSians!

“The supply chain stuff is really tricky.” ~Elon Musk

We are elated to announce the BITS Pilani Student Forum of ASCM (Association for Supply Chain Management). ASCM is the global leader in supply chain organizational transformation, innovation and leadership. As the largest nonprofit association for supply chain, ASCM is an unbiased partner, connecting supply chain professionals and companies around the world to the newest thought leadership on all aspects of supply chain. With over 37,000 members and 287 international partners, ASCM is transforming the way people do business, drive growth and reach global customers.

The ASCM Case Competition which is provided by ASCM in collaboration with Deloitte Consulting LLP provides student teams with an opportunity to enhance and test their supply chain knowledge by working on end-to-end supply chain challenges drawn from company experiences.

The primary objective for chartering the student forum is the limited existing supply chain management exposure and student-level professional opportunities in our campus. We believe that ASCM, BITS Pilani Student Forum will act as a valuable platform for students of all disciplines to improve their knowledge and skills in the domain of supply chain management.

The primary goal of an affiliate student chapter is to provide the touches of reality that complement and expand upon what students learn from textbooks or lectures. ASCM recognizes that the students of today will become the professionals of tomorrow. Student forum affiliation may provide students with the following benefits:

• Access to association resources and exposure to the field of operation management

• Contacts for potential career opportunities

• Skills development through certification such as APICS Certified in Production and Inventory Management (CPIM), APICS Certified Supply Chain Professional (CSCP) designations which set the industry standard.

• Actual work experience through cooperative education, internships, and special projects

• Opportunities for monetary awards from paper competitions, scholarships, case competitions, and work experience.

Indian IT talent getting packages of INR 60 LPA from MNCs - Is India's image changing as a source of cheap human resource?

Hi there, dev-aspirant!

Getting your dream job feels great but the best part comes when you tell your parents about it and they feel that all their hard work was worth it. But it does not come easy, nothing in life comes easy. A package of 32 Lakh would definitely not be a cakewalk, but does that mean you do not even try? 

We know placement rejections hit hard but let us tell you a secret, if you are at it, one day you will get it. 96 girl coders recently got placed via Walmart CodeHers at packages up to 26 LPA, many of those were from Tier 2/3 colleges! You again stand a chance to get hired by 25+ Companies as they have opened their doors for you via D2C Recruitables, the biggest off-campus hiring drive for software engineers where companies are hiring at salaries up to 32 LPA and internship stipend up to 90,000/ month.

Apply Now for D2C Recruitables!

Now all that is needed is grit, perseverance to ace it from your end. To take you a step closer to this dream we have released the mock assessment that will give you a complete picture of the actual assessment pattern. Take the mock assessment and get ahead in the game!

Take the mock assessment 

You can ace it!

Regards,
Team Dare2Compete

where university students are given the opportunity to use Adobe Analytics with real-world data from leading organizations. Last year over 4600 students from over 300 universities across 20 different countries competed for a huge amount in cash prizes.

Dear Students, 

Greetings from Project Expository!

Project Expository is an initiative under the Placement Unit that aims at creating guidance pathways for students.

To tackle the lack of knowledge about the core fields of engineering, we have decided to embark upon creating more awareness by curating a series of recorded podcasts of students who have interned/got placed at prestigious firms in the core sector.

To begin with, we have recorded two podcasts with BITSians who have bagged exceptional offers in the fields of ET and Mechanical core.

In the ET sector, we have esteemed speakers like Rahul (Interned at Nvidia), Piyush Raj Jha (Placed at Expressif Systems) and Ananya Khandelwal (Interned and placed at Micron Technologies). 

In mechanical core, we have Kanishk Chaudhary (Interned at Boston Scientific) giving his insights on the placement process.

The links for the same are as attached below-
1. ET podcast
2. Mechanical podcast

We would request you all to go through the recordings to get more insights on the internship and placement processes apart from the general overview of the respective core domains.

Thank you!
Team Project Expository

Dear Product Aspirants,

Are you preparing for your first product interview? Are you finding it difficult to see the immense amount of PM prep materials available but not knowing where to start? We are here for you. We, PM Buddy, is a volunteer-led group of significantly experienced Senior Product Managers trying to accelerate your Product journeys. All the mentors have at least 5+ years of core Product Management experience and have hired multiple APMs/PMs in their careers.

PM Buddy is delighted to bring you two programs, a Bootcamp focussed on Cracking Product Management interviews and a Mock Interview and Mentorship platform where you can partner up with experienced Product managers to do 1-on-1 product mock interviews. Both the programs were created with the sole purpose of helping students crack their first product job. Please refer to the individual sections below to know more about each of these programs.

Program 1 -  Cracking Product Management interviews Bootcamp

We understand that preparing for PM interviews is unstructured and complex - especially when you are appearing for your first Product Management interview. So, how would you differentiate yourself from the several other candidates? This Bootcamp aims to prepare you for just that and provide you with a structured approach to cracking Product interviews. This is a condensed course that is very specific and focused on interviews and is great for anyone appearing for PM interviews in the next few weeks or months. This will help you in product management interviews in your target companies such as Flipkart, Ola, CRED, Axis Bank, etc. The course is structured and timed in such a way that you will be ready by the time on-campus APM roles and off-campus product intern roles open up.

What do we offer - 

    Learning from experienced Product Managers with ~ 8+ years of experience in product and expertise in hiring APMs and Junior PMs

    Product portfolio building and mentorship sessions 

    Lifetime access to a community of like-minded people and experienced PMs

How is this course different -

    The course is delivered by mentors who have been hiring APMs, junior and senior PMs for a few years now and they bring in several years of industry experience

    The course focuses on structured interview prep that will help you learn and apply in your interviews very well

More details about the course are attached in the brochure.

    Course dates - 2nd(Sat) and 3rd(Sun) Oct 2021

Greetings from the Wall Street Club!

Have you wanted to invest in stock markets, but have found it difficult to pick stocks based on a thorough analysis? Wouldn’t it be great if you could get a sneak peek at the investment portfolios that return the highest yields, and make your trades by simply shadowing the masters? We have collaborated with Trinkerr, to help you do precisely that.

Trinkerr is building India's first social trading platform. It is a platform that enables retail investors to view, learn, follow, and execute the strategies of their peers or more experienced traders. The application integrates community features with trader discovery and trade execution. Backed by investors from Accel Partners, Udaan, Unacademy, and Titan Capital, it aims to make financial markets truly inclusive and democratic for the next 100 million users.


Trinkerr Street 1.0, India’s first real-money stock-trading competition, is an initiative for aspiring Fund Managers, Financial Analysts, and Wealth Managers from premier B-Schools, Engineering, BBA, and B.Com colleges to showcase their expertise in the domain of Portfolio Management.

Participants are expected to follow the Best Equity Portfolios already available on Trinkerr during the course of the event. Candidates stand a chance to win attractive cash prizes and goodies up to 3 Lakhs, and a special chance to bag internships/PPIs at Trinkerr.

Event Details :

Register here: Registration Form

(Please enter BITS ID number in place of “College Registration Number”)

The competition begins on 11th October as a 2-week event, where participants can invest money in the best portfolios and attempt to earn the highest returns. 

The deadline for registration is on 17th October 2021. Hurry up!

Join the official Discord server to stay up-to-date with the event details.

Please go through the brochure attached at the end of this mail to read all the rules about the competition, its timeline, information about brokerage accounts, etc. 

To ensure that you are well prepared for the competition, Trinkerr has organized a seminar by Stock Market Scientist, on 10th October, where he will talk about Stock Market Psychology, with the aid of the Kübler-Ross model, and the Classical Conditioning Model by Pavlov. Seminar links and all other updates will be shared with registered participants and those on the Discord server. 

Warm regards, 

Soham Kulkarni

Wall Street Club, BITS Pilani.

P.S. Stay tuned for the next round of recruitments!

Dear Student,

After the huge success of the inaugural batch of the Applied Deep Learning internship, we are back this December!

Inviting all applicants who missed out on the internship due to the limited number of seats in the inaugural batch, to enroll for the internship.


This LIVE online internship enables you to apply your knowledge of Deep Learning to solve real-world problems and work on innovative projects mentored directly by HPE's industry experts and trainers. 


Internship takeaways:

    Work on industry projects in Python, TensorFlow and Keras to deepen real-world understanding
    Design your Neural Network from scratch
     Learn advanced Deep Learning applications: Regularization methods, Hyper Parameter Tuning, Time Series Analysis
     Design and deploy deep learning solutions in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
    Simulate industry project team scenario and get trained on DevOps Azure


It’s crucial to have an edge in recruitment, or when you’re applying for your masters. Here’s a look at some of our alumni.

    Anubha Kabra, a graduate of Delhi Technological University (DTU), is currently working as a software engineer at Adobe. Read more about her journey here.
    Sarthak Goel, a graduate from Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (BITS Pilani), Goa is currently working as an analyst at Goldman Sachs.

Subject: Recruitments | BITS Pilani Consulting Club
From: "Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>

To: Students at Pilani Campus <students@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>
CC: Chief Warden <chiefwarden@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>

Greetings from BITS Pilani Consulting Club!


From a bunch of college-goers interested in the field of Consulting to a full-fledged group of over 20+ members focused on broadening their horizons and opportunities in the industry, the club sure has come a long way. A decade ago, the typical response to a mention of Consulting Club on the campus would be met by quizzical stares and awkward expressions, while people would try to figure out if they heard it wrong or whether it was some placement company that was in question. The club has managed to propagate consulting as a culture.


What does the club do?

Interactive activities like solving archived case studies, live cases, and guesstimates are focused on, to gain experience and expertise. Various current scenarios and new themes are discussed and debated during the sessions. There are also video conferences with Club Alumni, as well as ex BITSians, placed worldwide in major Consulting Firms, for the members to learn from. 


Who can join the club?
Contrary to the popular notion, a background in analytics, finance, or similar subjects is not necessary to join the club! All it requires is logic, common sense, and an urge to learn more. Over the years, club members have cracked top consults including Mckinsey, BCG, Bain & Co., etc., and have taken up challenging roles in related sectors like analytics, business development, and start-ups right after college.



BITS Pilani Consulting Club is now accepting applications from the 2021 and 2020 batches! There are no prior requisites to join the club, anyone from the 2021 and 2020 batch can apply to the club.

Use BITS mail to open the form.

Deadline to fill the application forms for second-year students: 14th November 2021 (23:59 pm)
Second-Year students are required to attach their resume in the form, a sample of which is present in the mail below.

We are looking for dedicated and hard-working individuals who are intrigued by the world of consulting. Join us to become a part of this club!
