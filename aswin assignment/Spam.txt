Welcome to the Specialization!
Ready to learn something new?	My CoursesCourse Catalog
Welcome to the Specialization!
You’ve just joined Autodesk CAD/CAM for Manufacturing Specialization. Congratulations—you’ve taken a huge step by committing to mastering a skill. We’re excited for you!
Before you dive in, we have a few tips to help you succeed:
1. Start with the first course. There are 4 courses and a Capstone Project in this Specialization. The first course is Introduction to CAD, CAM, and Practical CNC Machining. It's available to start today. 
2. Set a schedule and mark your calendar. There’s a lot of material to learn, and our most successful learners tell us they’re diligent about setting a schedule and sticking to it. In most Specializations you should plan to complete one course each 4-6 weeks.
3. Find a study group. Learners are much more likely to successfully complete a course if they enroll with friends, or connect with other learners in the course forums.
Best of luck as you get started. We’ll see you in Autodesk CAD/CAM for Manufacturing!

Dear ASWIN BENEDICT,

Welcome to Introduction to CAD, CAM, and Practical CNC Machining.

In this course, we’ll explore the basics of Autodesk® Fusion 360™ CAD by learning how to properly sketch and model 3D parts. Before we program any toolpaths, we’ll explore CNC machining basics to ensure we have the foundational knowledge needed to effectively define toolpaths.

Finally, we’ll explore the basics of setting up a CAM program and defining toolpaths to cut simple geometry.

It’s an exciting time, and we’re excited to have you with us. Here are some pointers that can help you through this course:

    Be ready. We’ll provide a lot of hands-on learning in the software. Sign up for an Autodesk account and download Fusion 360 now. Students and educators can download a free 3-year education license, while professionals and commercial users can access a free 30-day trial or subscribe to Fusion 360.

    Learn and earn. Complete all courses in the CAD/CAM for Manufacturing specialization to earn a digital badge and PDF certificate from Autodesk. Continue learning, then show off your new skills on your resume and on social media like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.

And enjoy!

We also encourage you to join the Autodesk Student community online to connect with thousands of like-minded peers from across the world.

All the best,

Autodesk

P.S. With thousands of learners enrolled, we can’t respond to individual questions or emails. We encourage you to call on this large community in the discussion forums to get your questions answered.
