Dear All,

Greetings from Practice School Division.

Practice School is a hallmark of the BITS Curriculum. Practice School is an educational innovation seeking to link industry experience with university instruction. Especially the capstone PS-II Program creates the required setting for experiential learning, by providing students with an opportunity to work on relevant assignments in an industry of their choice, under the guidance of professional experts and the supervision of faculty.

PS Division is happy to announce the release of the 7th edition PS-II Chronicles that is a compilation of student, mentor and faculty experience during PS- II in the second semester of the academic year 2018-19.

The students, industry mentors, and PS-II faculty have come-up with write-ups that offer an insight into the learning experience during PS-II.

The student write-ups are a window into the learning outcomes, the gap between academia and industry, and the day-to-day experiences of students as part of PS-II.

Mentor Write-ups reflect their working experience with BITS Students in all aspects of the student knowledge, academic preparation and work ethics.

PSD hopes that these chronicles will help every reader understand the type of work done by students in PS-II and will provide the necessary feedback path that will help bridge the industry-academia gap.

The chronicle is a must-read for Prospective PS-II Students as this will help understand the work that is happening at various PS Stations and what do the PS-II Mentors look for in terms of skill set.  It will help the student make an informed choice when filling the preference forms. The 7th edition of the PS-II chronicles is attached with this mail.

Thank you

Students' Talk Series 

 Talk No.- 1

"The Earth isn't perfectly round! And why it matters."

Greetings!

Physics Association is pleased to announce the first talk of the Students' Talk Series this semester by Avinash Sontakke, a 3rd-year student of M.Sc. Physics and B.E. Computer Science Engineering. Avinash did his PS-1 in Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune.

Abstract:

The motion of an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth depends heavily on the gravitational field in which it moves. The mass, shape, and density distribution of the Earth plays a crucial role in determining the gravitational field around it. Using this principle, one can, from the motion of the satellite, computationally arrive at an estimate of the shape of the Earth. The talk will focus on how the gravitational field changes when we deviate from a spherically symmetric Earth and how this new field affects orbiters in space.

 

Time: 5-5:45 pm

Venue: 6103

Day and Date: 15th November, Friday

The CMU RISS program is designed to immerse students in the world of robotics. Through RISS, students perform research under the mentorship of top scientists in robotics and artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute. RISS works with over 50 research mentors representing a broad range of robotics research (e.g. field robotics, computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence, autonomy, machine learning, graphics, human-robot interaction, and space robotics).

 

The RISS-guided research experience is coupled with powerful professional development and hands-on robotics experiences with industry leaders in a nurturing global community.  The program culminates with an annual research poster session and the publication of the RISS Working Papers Journal. Many students continue to collaborate with RISS mentors, labs, and cohort members.

 

More information about the program, including prior research posters and papers (2019 the RISS Working Papers Journal) can be found here.

Dear All,

Greetings from Practice School Division.

Practice School is a hallmark of the BITS Curriculum. Practice School is an educational innovation seeking to link industry experience with university instruction. Especially the capstone PS-II  program creates the required setting for experiential learning, by providing students with an opportunity to work on relevant assignments in an industry of their choice, under the guidance of professional experts and the supervision of faculty.

PS Division is happy to announce the release of the 8th edition PS-II Chronicles that is a compilation of student, mentor and faculty experience during PS- II in the first semester of the academic year 2019-20.

The students, industry mentors, and PS-II faculty have come-up with write-ups that offer an insight into the learning experience during PS-II.

The student write-ups are a window into the learning outcomes, the gap between academia and industry, and the day-to-day experiences of students as part of PS-II.

Mentor Write-ups reflect their working experience with BITS Students in all aspects of the student knowledge, academic preparation and work ethics.

PSD hopes that these chronicles will help every reader understand the type of work done by students in PS-II and will provide the necessary feedback path that will help bridge the industry-academia gap.

The chronicles are a must-read for Prospective PS-II Students as this will help understand the work that is happening at various PS Stations and what do the PS-II Mentors look for in terms of skill set.  It will help the student make an informed choice when filling the preference forms — the 8th edition of the PS-II chronicles, with this mail.

Thank you

Dear All,

BITS Pilani Library is pleased to announce the addition of a new facility "E-Interview Carrel" in the lobby near Staff Office.  

It's often observed that students aren't able to find appropriate space if they have an interview scheduled on Video Call for their internship, placement, project or research-related matters using the internet.

Keeping this in mind, an isolated carrel is being put up in Digitization Lab near Staff Office with a computer equipped with a good quality webcam, microphone and LAN connectivity.

Most common video call software is installed on the computer.

Students can soon book this facility as per their convenience through the library portal. Until then, one can send their request to use this facility  to the following e-mail address:

helpdesk.library@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in

Please note that this facility is not for personal use.

We sincerely believe you will make good use of this facility.

Participants registering have to attend the entire session to become a certified Youth Mental Health First Aider (certified by YMHFA Australia and MPower).

SRISTI will also share a few unmet social needs with the selected participants. You are free to work on a problem of your choice also at the Summer School, which can be different from the one you submit during application.  As long as it addresses a clearly defined unmet need of disadvantaged sections of society it will be welcome. However, the group work will be pursued on already identified social challenges unless a team can convince the group that its chosen problem is far more important and urgent.

Experts from CSIR, DBT, DST and other institutions in India and abroad will interact with the participants.

we will form interdisciplinary groups which will collaborate virtually through HBN communities app and bluebutton.org platform

Target group size: 60 candidates to be announced by May 20, 2020.

 

Outcome

Five to seven proof of concept, processes, Apps, and service/system design to move from mind to market-social or commercial but preferably openly accessible to users

It is understood that several ideas/products will need considerably more design and fabrication effort to make them useful for the target users/communities. SRISTI is committed to follow up each solution and keep the original group informed and engaged if they so wish. All the solutions will be shared with the user community in open source. In some cases, the defensive patent may be filed to prevent any third party monopolizing the design. SRISTI will have full right to share the solutions developed during summer school to modify, change or improve for the larger social good. The students can come back to follow  up their summer assignment.

Sponsors who may wish to join the efforts are welcome to contact us

Though this place has evolved a lot, the core feelings and echo of the institute have remained the same over these years. Mr. Kashyap will talk about his personal experiences, coupled with an informal interaction that would surely benefit all of the BITSians in continuing the legacy. He will also touch upon his career in the rural marketing space and how he has reimagined the field completely.

Dear All, 

Greetings!

From Pilani Innovation & Entrepreneurship Development Society

UK Government has launched a £3m million Innovation Challenge Fund to support scientists in academia and industry to tackle today’s most acute global challenges: COVID 19 and climate change.   

The Fund invites tech innovators with connections to the AI-Data cluster in Karnataka and the Future Mobility cluster in Maharashtra to submit research and development proposals for tackling COVID-19, or which promote a greener planet.  At least 12 grants of up to £250,000 are expected to be awarded. Applicants are required to submit bids as an academic-industry consortia, ideally with an international member. 

The deadline for submitting for two-page concept notes is 31st August and further details about the Future Mobility Innovation Challenge Fund are available on the website. There will be an initial Q&A session on Thursday 20th August for which an invite will be circulated soon. Further roundtables will be announced on their LinkedIn group.

This initiative builds on the Indian and British Prime Ministers’ commitment to bring together the best minds from both countries under the UK-India Tech Partnership, to deliver high-skilled jobs and economic growth. Both Covid-19 and climate change demonstrate that the most urgent challenges are global. 

Best wishes

'Career in the Social Sector'


Hope everyone is keeping well!

 

The social impact sector has always been one of the most promising yet challenging sectors to work in. In an effort to bust numerous myths surrounding this sector and to encourage greater participation, Pilani AtmaNirbhar Resource Center (PARC), in collaboration with Enactus, presents a very thought-provoking talk about 'Career(s) in the social sector'. 


Our speaker for this session is Mr. Shobhit Mathur.

 

About the Speaker: Mr. Mathur is an alumnus of IIT Bombay, University of Washington and the Indian School of Business. He has worked with Amazon.com in Seattle and served as the Joint National Organizing Secretary of Youth For Seva. He is currently the Executive Director of Vision India Foundation. The goal of Vision India Foundation is to create the future Public leaders of India. The foundation identifies, trains and mentors young talent to inculcate a top-down approach - through social impact. 

 

We aim to focus on questions like:

    What are the various career options in the non-profit and social sector?
    Why is working in the social sector not seen as a prominent career option? 
    Is working for the social impact sector a financially viable and secure career choice?

 

The necessary details for the talk are as follows:


Time: 5pm

Date: 22nd August'20


For registering and all your questions, kindly fill in this Google Form.


We hope that his valuable insights would nurture a greater percentage of the young crowd to drive their career in the social sector.

Dear All,

Greetings from Practice School Division.

Practice School is a hallmark of the BITS Curriculum. Practice School is an educational innovation seeking to link industry experience with university instruction. Especially the capstone PS-II Program creates the required setting for experiential learning, by providing students with an opportunity to work on relevant assignments in an industry of their choice, under the guidance of professional experts and the supervision of faculty.

PS Division is happy to announce the release of the 9th edition PS-II Chronicles that is a compilation of student, mentor and faculty experience during PS- II in the second semester of the academic year 2019-20.

The students, industry mentors, and PS-II faculty have come-up with write-ups that offer an insight into the learning experience during PS-II.

The student write-ups are a window into the learning outcomes, the gap between academia and industry, and the day-to-day experiences of students as part of PS-II.

Mentor Write-ups reflect their working experience with BITS Students in all aspects of the student knowledge, academic preparation and work ethics.

PSD hopes that these chronicles will help every reader understand the type of work done by students in PS-II and will provide the necessary feedback path that will help bridge the industry-academia gap.

The chronicles are a must-read for Prospective PS-II Students as this will help understand the work that is happening at various PS Stations and what do the PS-II Mentors look for in terms of skill set.  It will help the student make an informed choice when filling the preference forms — the 9th edition of the PS-II chronicles, with this mail.

Thank you

Dear Students, 

Greetings!

The Placement Awareness Committee (PAC) , with an aim to promote important industry skills, has come up with Special Interest Groups (SIGs). A community for collaboration and upskilling, each of these groups would be focused on a specific domain and will be placement oriented.

The first of these SIGs, will be focused on Product Management. In collaboration with the PM Club, Product Management - SIG aims at cultivating the product leaders of tomorrow and instilling a feeling of excitement for Product Management in the student body.

The field of Product Management is gaining popularity with every passing day, thanks to its unique problem-solving aspects and exciting career prospects. However, being a relatively nascent field (especially for undergrads) there arise a few natural questions in the minds of those looking to make a dive, such as:

    I don’t know anything about this field but I find it interesting. Can I still become a PM?

    What skills are actually required for being a Product Manager?

    What courses should I do/work experience should I undertake to prepare for this role?

To get the best answers for these crucial questions, join the Product Management - SIG Workspace on Slack. We invite all product enthusiasts on the campus to the Workspace, providing them with a repository of amazing resources to know the field better. The group will also serve as the main platform for all official announcements about the activity the Club undertakes. It will also act as a space for insightful discussions with the best in business out there.

Fill this Google Form to get an invite to the workspace. The deadline for the same is September 29th, 2020.

Hola BITSians!

“Let everyone else call your idea crazy... just keep going. Don’t stop. Don’t even think about stopping until you get there, and don’t give much thought to where ‘there’ is. Whatever comes, just don’t stop.” - Phil Knight

We are glad and proud to announce that Pepper, the largest content marketplace in India, which bloomed out of our very own campus have raised their Series-A funding of USD 4.2. million (INR 31.6 Crores) from Lightspeed Venture Partners and marquee angels like Beerud Sheth (Founder, Upwork), Balaji Srinivasan (Coinbase CTO, ex-GP at a16z), Gaurav Munjal (Founder, Unacademy), Aakrit Vaish (Founder, Haptik), Miten Sampat (ex-CSO, Times Internet), Akhil Paul (Caparo Group), Utsav Somani (iSeed/AngelList), Dilipkumar Khandelwal (Ex-MD, SAP Labs India) and Gaurav Mandlecha (Product Evangelist, Airmeet).

Starting from a dorm room here at BITS to their entire team managing college with a venture of this scale, we are extremely proud of 21-year old Pepper co-founders Anirudh Singla and Rishabh Shekhar to have managed this feat so early in the age. This would be incomplete with a huge mention to their team - Kishan Panpalia, Himanshu Goyal, Aadesh Chandra, Aditya Sudhanshu, and Pranav Goyal without whom, this was just impossible.

They are probably the youngest folks in India to have raised an institutional amount of this sum. Kudos!

What started as a team of 5 people from BITS has grown to a 35+ members' team operating from Mumbai and we wish the entire Pepper team very good luck for the future!

It will also be a significant opportunity for all those individuals who want the first-hand experience of managing a flagship event and learn about the different responsibilities that have to be undertaken to hold a flagship event on campus. This event will solely be governed by the chartering members of this club, which will help them to polish their leadership skills.


We believe that every person you meet in your life counts as an event. You can leave an excellent impression on that person if you have good public speaking skills because only then will you influence that person and convey your ideas in the best way possible. At Toastmasters, we will make all of this possible. We raise a toast to this new culture that BITS Pilani has embraced.

Greetings from CEL!


Summer in a Startup (SiS), an annual internship program, is an initiative taken by CEL to help students learn and grow in the dynamic startup ecosystem through internships. We strive to provide internship opportunities to BITSians, to develop their careers with hands-on experience. 


As part of our project, we get you another internship opportunity at Cashfree. Here is a brief description.


***************

Cashfree is a payment and banking technology company, based out of Bangalore. As a complete payments platform, it helps 50,000+ businesses collect and send money with solutions such as an easy to integrate payment gateway that supports instant refunds; Payouts - an API banking platform for disbursals; a split payment solution for marketplaces; a Bank Account Verification API; a dedicated UPI stack for businesses and Auto Collect - a virtual account solution to match inbound payments to customers. It counts Xiaomi, Tencent, Zomato, Zoomcar, Cred, Club Factory, Shell, Google-backed Dunzo as well as donation platforms like Ketto and Milaap amongst its customers. Cashfree is working with all leading banks such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Yes Bank to build the core payments and banking infrastructure that powers Cashfree’s products. Cashfree is also integrated with major platforms like Shopify, Wix, Paypal, Amazon Pay, Ola Money, and Google Pay.

Cashfree was launched in 2015 as a payment gateway. While operating the payment gateway, the founders, Akash and Reeju, found it difficult to use online bank portals for disbursing payments every day. In mid-2016, Cashfree decided to work on building a dedicated bulk Payouts solution for businesses operating in India. (YC-backed Cashfree recently raised $35.3 million for its payments platform)

Dear Fresher,

Hope you are in good health. The Mid Semester examinations just got over, and we hope that your Peer Mentor helped you to the best of their capabilities.

Here are some tips to make the best out of the Peer Mentorship Program:

    Stay in touch with your mentor. This will help them understand you and help you more effectively.
    Never hesitate to talk about anything. The Program strives to maintain the utmost level of confidentiality. This means that you can share any incident or problem with your mentor, and expect speedy solution.
    Be explicit. You are responsible for communicating about your needs to your mentor. If you need someone to talk to, approach your mentor about this. If you need a group to hang out with, express this on your mentee group. Remember, the Mentee group is your first social circle on campus, and the mentor is your first Point of Contact.

We would also like to announce that most of you have already been allotted a mentor. 
If you have applied and not been allotted a mentor, contact the Executive Committee. If you have not already registered for getting a mentor, please do so now: CLICK HERE TO GET A MENTOR

Subject: Team Anant || Recruitment
From: "Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>

To: Students at Pilani Campus <students@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>

Greetings!

Team Anant, the Student Satellite team, will be conducting a recruitment test for interested students from the 2019 and 2020 batches. The team comprises six technical subsystems that span the various engineering disciplines and one Publicity and Sponsorship team.

Payload: While the human eye is restricted to seeing EM waves in the visible region, our payload, a multispectral imager, gets a glimpse of the spectrum that we can never detect with our naked eye. The Payload team designs this assembly and extracts valuable insights about our planet's forests from the captured data.

On-Board Computer: OBC is called the brain of the satellite. They are responsible for the vital task of coordination and is the main string-puller of all the satellite operations. 
‌
Telemetry & Ground Station: Their motive is never to let the satellite go incommunicado. Telemetry & Ground station subsystem is responsible for establishing and maintaining the communication link between the Earth and our satellite.

Structural & Thermal: During its operation, the satellite will face powerful vibrations at launch and will have to thrive in the unforgiving environment of space. Structure and Thermal ensure that the satellite body and components can survive these extreme mechanical conditions.

Attitude Determination & Control: Imaging the Earth requires complicated orientation maneuvers and sensing. The ADCS focuses on designing the satellite's trajectory and getting the camera facing the right way at the right time.

Electrical Power: Powering up the satellite, EPS is responsible for generating the satellite's power and distributing it when required to different components.

Publicity and Sponsorship: Building a satellite requires money and resources. This subsystem makes sure that we have all the resources we want. The Publicity & Sponsorship team is also responsible for increasing awareness about our mission.

We will be recruiting for all seven subsystems.

Designing technology to operate and survive in space requires high engineering precision and expertise from multiple disciplines. Artificial satellites have been orbiting the earth since the 1960s, and in each case, integration of all the different parts into a single functioning whole has been a monumental task. If you're even remotely interested in learning how to design a satellite, we would highly encourage you to give the test a shot. It's a fun but challenging paper that requires almost no prior knowledge except for what you've already learned in school. 

Fill in this google form to register for the recruitment process. The personal details will be used to contact you. The number you provide will be added to a Whatsapp group where any test announcements will be put up. The form will accept responses till 26th January 2021 at 11:59:59 PM.

In case of any queries, contact the undersigned.

Greetings!


The Students’ Union Technical Team constantly keeps on working in an effort to improve and introduce new features in our existing range of products and services. We are glad to announce major updates to the Official Student Union App and WebPortal with a vision to make campus life Easy, Efficient and Smart. 

The SU App caters to all the student needs in a quick, simple and efficient manner. With integration of loads of features in a single app, you don’t need to download separate apps for various utilities.

> Expenditure Overview:

Keep a track of all the details of transactions made via our Real-Time Expense tracking mechanism upgraded to a new level.

Track all the transactions made for a single day, month or even for the whole semester on a single screen.

> Signings System:

A transparent system that offers an ingenious alternative to traditional mess signings and cancellations by which you can sign up or cancel your favourite merchandise or register for events directly from your mobile app just by sitting in your room.

You can rest assured that once logged in with your BITS ID, there is zero scope of fake signings and complete transparency. Following the integration with Expenditure Overview, you can also view how many events/merchandise you have signed up for so that you can keep a check on your expenses while enjoying campus life.

> Study Zone:

An academic portal where you can get all the resources you need to ace your exams. Be ready for a  personalised learning experience by getting access to hundreds of lecture slides, handouts, previous year's questions papers and other academic documents for all your courses in college. Say goodbye to last minute notes gathering and photocopying because the Study Zone provides for everything right on your screen.

> QR based Verification:

Keeping in mind the concerns of student privacy and security, every student on campus is provided with a unique QR code to ensure safe and transparent transactions.

In addition to these features, we have been working on improving some of the features based on your feedback over the past few months. The new update includes but is not limited to:

1) Uploading and Rating resources in StudyZone:  Students can now contribute and upload academic resources like previous year’s question papers, slides or any other course related reading material which, upon verification by our moderators will be made available for everyone to use. To further ensure maintenance of quality, we have also introduced a feature to rate or report the resources uploaded by students.

2) Registration and records of club and department members: Coordinators of various clubs and departments can now directly register their members via the Student Union App. This will help identify a team member and avoid impersonation. Maintaining a list of members and positions held within various student bodies will be simplified and automated.

With his starting investment in Oyo, he helped the company with the initial seed capital and investment when nobody else was and assisted the company in becoming what it is today. Oyo later became a unicorn and as a result, Artha Ventures made a whopping 150x return on their investment. Thanks to his spate of great investments, Mr Anirudh was ranked second in the list of India’s Top Investors in 2016 by VCCEdge, just behind Mr Ratan Tata.

Therefore, to disseminate important information regarding the same, a GBM meet has been scheduled with the Acting Council of the Student Union on Monday, 22nd March 2021.

The agenda of this meet would be to discuss viable ways of reopening campus for the batches 2018 and below as soon as possible as well as to increase direct communication between SU and the GBM. The meet would serve as a platform for GBM to raise any problems being faced by them and would also be open to pitches from new clubs, which would have to be intimated earlier.
We are very optimistic that major breakthroughs would be seen in these areas due to our sustained efforts and we would be successful in bringing back normalcy very soon.

image.png

The Alumni Relations Office is pleased to announce that Chaitanya Kalipatnapu (’97 | Pilani) has pledged a substantial contribution towards building an Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality Lab (AR/VR Lab). The Lab shall primarily be an exploratory space for the students and faculty of Pilani Campus, in addition to being a space for building innovative and creative solutions in the field of AR/VR.

The AR/VR Lab shall eventually be set up in the Incubation and Innovation Centre, coming up in Pilani Campus. A governing board shall guide the lab’s functioning, while Dr. Mukesh Rohil and his colleagues at the Computer Science Department will anchor the setting up and functioning of the lab.

When we asked Chaitanya about his opinion on what would make this lab successful, he said, “BITS has played a pivotal role in shaping my outlook and in my entrepreneurial journey. It is an honor and privilege to be able to give back to the Alma mater. I hope the state-of-the-art Lab will enable students to get hands-on experience with emerging technologies, and to positively impact our future through projects, patents and ventures.”

At an appropriate time, we shall circulate more details about the lab – equipment, working protocols etc. We could not be more excited to see this lab growing with a strong presence of students and faculty in the lab.

We hope that we will soon see you on campus, and hopefully, at the lab too.

We are thankful to Chaitanya for his contribution and support to BITS Pilani, and for providing this unique opportunity to BITSian innovators.

Greetings from the Department of Professional Studies,

CHRIST (Deemed to be University)

Being built on the principles of holistic education, innovative and progressive curriculum, Christ University has always focused on all-round learning.

The department of professional studies of Christ University is heralded as the renegade for change through differentiation in its programs by not only

encouraging holistic education and assimilating professionalism through its teaching pedagogy of inculcating few of the world's most acclaimed courses but

also through the plethora of exposure it provides to the student community through extracurricular activities. 

We are ecstatic to announce the thirteenth edition of Cognito, our national A-level intercollegiate Management fest! Cognito is the flagship event conducted by the

Department of Professional Studies and ever since its inception, the fest aims to bring its participants closer to the corporate interface reality. What sets Cognito aside

from other fests is that every round follows a storyline and the contingent faces tasks that represent the various managerial issues that a corporate does and would be

expected to resolve them by displaying keen commercial acumen. Cognito brings the corporate world right to you this time!        

Cognito has evolved exponentially in terms of scope and reach over the past 13 years, creating a platform for itself in the domain of Management festing.

This year, despite the pandemic we prepare to carry our legacy forward through the virtual

mode creating a global interface as we provide the students with a platform to flaunt their

Commercial and business skills. As we take participants into the world of the Corporates, we cordially invite you to our prestigious institution to participate in Cognito 2021.

We are excited to invite you to be a part of Cognito 2021-22, as contenders battle it out with the best of the best from across the globe. We look forward to your participation in

this event on the 8th, 9th and 10th of April, 2021. Contingent registrations close on March 25 (25/03/2021) and Quiz Registrations close on April 5 (05/04/2021).

Dear All,

Greetings from Practice School Division.

Practice School is a hallmark of the BITS Curriculum. Practice School is an educational innovation seeking to link industry experience with university instruction.

Especially the capstone PS-II Program creates the required setting for experiential learning, by providing students with an opportunity to work on relevant assignments in an industry of their choice,

under the guidance of professional experts and the supervision of faculty.

PS Division is happy to announce the release of the 10th edition PS-II Chronicles that is a compilation of student, mentor, and faculty experience during PS- II in the first semester of the academic year 2020-21.

The students, industry mentors, and PS-II faculty have come up with write-ups that offer an insight into the learning experience during PS-II.

The student write-ups are a window into the learning outcomes, the gap between academia and industry, and the day-to-day experiences of students as part of PS-II.

Mentor Write-ups reflect their working experience with BITS Students in all aspects of the student knowledge, academic preparation, and work ethics.

PSD hopes that these chronicles will help every reader understand the type of work done by students in PS-II and will provide the necessary feedback path that will help bridge the industry-academia gap.

The chronicles are a must-read for Prospective PS-II Students as this will help understand the work that is happening at various PS Stations and what do the PS-II Mentors look for in terms of skill set.

It will help the student make an informed choice when filling the preference.

 

The 10th edition of the PS-II chronicles is available at the following link:

NSS BITS-Pilani is proud to announce
Our next online talk on

Safeguarding our Future Society Through Cybersecurity
By
Mr. Raj Samani

ABOUT THE SPEAKER:
NSS BITS Pilani is extremely delighted to announce that we will be hosting Mr. Raj Samani for our next talk. Mr. Raj Samani is working as the Chief Scientist at McAfee and CTO at Intel Security. Samani has assisted multiple law enforcement agencies in cybercrime cases and is a special advisor to the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in The Hague. He has 59 publications to his name and has been identified as one of the top 50 most influential leaders in the cybersecurity industry.

ABOUT THE TALK:
We have often heard "Data is the new oil" but Mr. Samani has a different outlook on data. He believes that "Data is the new currency". This can be observed when Facebook bought WhatsApp for $16 billion even though the direct revenue from WhatsApp wasn't great. So, what was it exactly buying? That's right, you guessed it, it's data-our personal data, in the form of contacts, pictures, videos, and now, bank details because we can transfer money over WhatsApp.
This was back in 2014. In 2021, there is data leaking from our homes in ways we cannot imagine. From your PS4 to Alexa, everything is storing data-your voice, what you are saying, your location, everything. Keeping this in mind, NSS BITS Pilani has invited Samani to help us realize the importance of data security as well as understand that how every single piece of our data is monetized and that we have every right to protect it so that we do not end up becoming the product.

Greetings fellow BITSians!

 

 

The Safety and Medical Advisory Council is proud to announce the launch of our website!

  As you may have guessed, we are responsible for the safety of all the students on campus. Be it encountering the occasional snake in your hostel or you, very unfortunately, breaking a bone(or several) during BOSM, we have your back. Our primary contribution comes in when we set up camp in the heart of two of our fests, BOSM and Oasis, where we provide first aid and medical resources to everybody on campus. We also ensure the overall safety and hygiene of our campus throughout the year.

 

The world around us is changing rapidly, some of us going through it gracefully, but if you're anything like me, there is probably a lot of kicking and screaming. With this, how each of us remains safe and healthy has changed as well. We now have to maintain our physical health from the confines of our homes and pay a lot more attention to our mental health. This website provides a few ways to survive, if not conquer, life in lockdown. It also introduces SMAC, the people, and the work behind-the-scenes . It includes information to contact us for all your health and safety needs on campus. But, we would be happy to hear from you until then, so feel free to reach out.

While you are there, do not forget to check our blog section which we regularly update to keep the general BITSian community informed about the various aspects of health and well-being. Currently, our blogs regarding maintaining physical and mental fitness at home are up . In these, we describe how to keep your physique in check using minimal equipment and a sustainable diet, and how to stay sane during the insane times of online education.

 

Without taking any more of your time, We cordially invite you to visit our website at:

The Historical and Masonry Structures (HMS) group of the Institute for Sustainability and Innovation in Structural Engineering (ISISE), University of Minho, Portugal, plans to open a PhD student position (duration of the contract planned for 3 years) within the STAND4HERITAGE project, which is funded by a European Research Council Advanced Grant.

The position will focus on the definition of a set of new standards combined with an integrated analytical approach for the out-of-plane seismic assessment and subsequent intervention design of heritage masonry buildings. This is the main challenge of S4H, since it introduces rational rules for a task that has been approached mainly empirically.

Necessary qualifications: MSc degree in Civil Engineering or equivalent with some background in structural and seismic engineering. Additional experience in programming (e.g. Matlab, Python, Grasshopper), numerical simulations or similar qualifications would be considered an asset. Students completing their MSc degree this summer are invited to demonstrate their interest in the position.

If interested, please send your motivation letter and your résumé with a copy of the BSc and MSc certificate to Dr Marco Francesco Funari (marcofrancesco.funari@civil.uminho.pt) until Wednesday, June 23th (23:59 GMT). Students completing the MSc degree this summer must provide together with the BSc Diploma, the current courses certificate and GPA.

Please feel free to share this announcement.

Greetings from Hitbullseye.com!

With the current pandemic situation easing down and the number of active cases reducing on a regular basis, the corporates have been gearing up to scale up their workforces.

The national survey reports suggest an upward trend in the hiring process from the previous year as the offices reopen after long-lasting work from home setup and reduced man-power at most of the corporations.

We therefore need to prepare the students for the upcoming placement drives at your institute which will lay a foundation for them to easily be able to ace their tests for their dream companies. 
Being an organization that strives on the motto of "Don't be Reactive, But Pro-Active", we are proud to announce "Big Bull Test Marathon", a national level testing event wherein the students will not only be able to benchmark themselves nation-wide but also have a chance to win some exclusive Merchandise from us!

pu6july21.jpg

What's in it:

The students will be able to attempt 5 - Full Length Company Specific Tests which will be on the same pattern and difficulty levels as the actual tests over a period of 2 days (10th & 11th July) wherein they'll be provided with the detailed analysis of each test along with their National Rank.
These tests will be in-lines to their current education (B.Tech/BCA/BBA/MBA etc.)

All students who participate in the event (attempt all 5 tests), will be provided with a certificate of Participation from Hitbullseye.com which adds up to their resume and is well recognized by the corporates.

The Top 15 Rankers pan India will win exclusive merchandise from Hitbullseye.com along-with the Certificate of Appreciation.

Hey Everyone! 📢

Free up your Saturday evening because we have something extraordinary planned for you ⭐️

We’re excited to announce that on July 24th, humit in partnership with bluelearn.in will be hosting a bunch of incredibly talented indie artists for a Music Nite via zoom. Two BITSian startups have decided to join hands in organizing a virtual musical showcase for the entire student community amidst the pandemic. For the uninitiated, humit is a social app reimagining the way people discover, share and express themselves with their taste in music. 

EVENT DETAILS:
Time: 9 PM
Date: 24th July (Saturday)
RSVP for invite: https://bit.ly/musicnight24

On that note, HUGE shoutout to our wonderful artists for their eagerness to be a part of this event!!

We’re thrilled to have singer-songwriter Tanmaya Bhatnagar headlining the show, whose rise to fame was expedited when her popular single “Kya Tum Naraaz Ho?” gained recognition from Oscar-winning musician A. R. Rahman. Give it a listen! 🤩

We are beyond grateful for Frizzell D’Souza as well, whose long-time kinship with music propelled her newfound journey of songwriting. Check out her recent debut single, “New” for a snippet of what you’re in for!

We’re also super hyped to have musician Rohan Shetty “SHOR” and Neyhal put on short & spectacular showcases for us on that evening, so don’t miss out! It’s going to be a field day for our BITSian community.

Btw if you were wondering, this can absolutely get better than it already is. Hop onto humit's discord server here  and stay connected with the amazing community.

So see you all on Saturday evening!

Greetings from the Student Alumni Relations Cell, Pilani Campus!

It is overwhelming to see that the whole BITSian community is geared up for the ceremonial occasion of the BITSians’ day. As is customary, BITSians' Day is celebrated on the first Friday of August every year. Since its inception in 2013, it has grown in prominence with each passing year and has become an occasion which BITSians eagerly look forward to – a chance to reunite with old mates, forge new bonds, relive old memories and make some new ones.

It gives us great pleasure to announce that joining us this year, we have Mr Garv Malik. His journey from being a student at BITS Pilani, working in some great companies, to finally deciding to start all over again as a standup comedian is truly an inspiration. Garv has performed in 750+ shows across 35+ cities and 4 countries. Before pursuing his dream profession, he has served in various capacities in companies like Shuttl and Larsen & Toubro. He graduated from BITS Pilani with a bachelor’s degree in Civil engineering in the year 2015.

Do join us on 7th August, 9M for “Saturday Night Lite with Garv Malik”, a chance to enjoy, giggle and laugh your heads off.

The event has been organised with the spirit to give back to our society. We urge you to donate to the BITSAA COVID-19 Daily Wagers Support Initiative, a fundraiser run by the Pilani Campus and BITSAA for the workers affected by COVID.

Dear Students 

Greetings from The FIRP (Forum of International Relations and Public Policy), BITS Pilani Goa campus. We would like to thank all of you for an overwhelming response to our Special Lecture on 'International Careers for Young Indians' with the speaker, Ms. Akshaya Shivkumar (World Bank, Washington DC). 

We are excited to announce the confirmation of our Public Policy research project in the PetCare domain in association with Zibatech Wellness Pvt. Ltd, a startup by IIT Delhi alumni. Apply Now using the link  https://forms.gle/2dg6n8VMZWHQQSve6

The details of the project are as follows:

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been multiple incidents in the media wherein we observed that there was a huge influx of people who adopted pets during the lockdown. But the downside to that was the number of animals being abandoned on streets also increased manifolds.

Seeing and observing these trends, The FIRP (Forum of International Relations and Public Policy), BITS Pilani Goa (https://www.facebook.com/ThefirpBITSGoa) in collaboration with an IITD alumni startup, Zibatech Wellness Pvt. Ltd (https://www.zibatechs.com/our-initiatives), has launched a program where we are working on a research project to identify major policy decisions that may help to stop these incidences of abandonment and are collecting a database of all the pet owners in India for making a community where we can help people struggling in taking care of their pets by finding new parents for their pets within that community.

This is a callout for any interested volunteers who want to help us in this journey of ours.

All the interns cum volunteers will receive the following incentives:
1. Co-endorsed Internship Completion Certificate from The FIRP and Zibatech Wellness Pvt. Ltd.
2. Letter of Recommendation and Appreciation endorsed by alumni from IIT Delhi and BITS Pilani for top 15 volunteers
3. A honorarium of rupees 1000 INR and goodies from Zibatech Wellness for the top-performing volunteers (depends on your performance)

“The supply chain stuff is really tricky.” ~Elon Musk

We are elated to announce the BITS Pilani Student Forum of ASCM (Association for Supply Chain Management). ASCM is the global leader in supply chain organizational transformation, innovation and leadership. As the largest nonprofit association for supply chain, ASCM is an unbiased partner, connecting supply chain professionals and companies around the world to the newest thought leadership on all aspects of supply chain. With over 37,000 members and 287 international partners, ASCM is transforming the way people do business, drive growth and reach global customers.

The ASCM Case Competition which is provided by ASCM in collaboration with Deloitte Consulting LLP provides student teams with an opportunity to enhance and test their supply chain knowledge by working on end-to-end supply chain challenges drawn from company experiences.

The primary objective for chartering the student forum is the limited existing supply chain management exposure and student-level professional opportunities in our campus. We believe that ASCM, BITS Pilani Student Forum will act as a valuable platform for students of all disciplines to improve their knowledge and skills in the domain of supply chain management.

The primary goal of an affiliate student chapter is to provide the touches of reality that complement and expand upon what students learn from textbooks or lectures. ASCM recognizes that the students of today will become the professionals of tomorrow. Student forum affiliation may provide students with the following benefits:

• Access to association resources and exposure to the field of operation management

• Contacts for potential career opportunities

• Skills development through certification such as APICS Certified in Production and Inventory Management (CPIM), APICS Certified Supply Chain Professional (CSCP) designations which set the industry standard.

• Actual work experience through cooperative education, internships, and special projects

• Opportunities for monetary awards from paper competitions, scholarships, case competitions, and work experience.

Dear All,
Greetings from Practice School Division.
Practice School is a hallmark of the BITS Curriculum. Practice School is an educational innovation seeking to link industry experience with university instruction. Especially the capstone PS-II Program creates the required setting for experiential learning by providing students with an opportunity to work on relevant assignments in an industry of their choice, under the guidance of professional experts and the supervision of faculty.

PS Division is happy to announce the release of the 11th edition PS-II Chronicles that is a compilation of student, mentor, and faculty experience during PS- II in the second semester of the academic year 2020-21. The students, industry mentors, and PS-II faculty have come up with write-ups that offer an insight into the learning experience during PS-II. The student write-ups are a window into the learning outcomes, the gap between academia and industry, and the day-to-day experiences of students as part of PS-II. Mentor Write-ups reflect their working experience with BITS Students in all aspects of the student knowledge, academic preparation, and work ethics.

PSD hopes that these chronicles will help every reader understand the type of work done by students in PS-II and will provide the necessary feedback path that will help bridge the industry-academia gap.  The chronicles are a must-read for Prospective PS-II Students as this will help understand the work that is happening at various PS Stations and what do the PS-II Mentors look for in terms of skill set.  It will help the student make an informed choice when filling the preference.

The 11th edition of the PS-II chronicles is available at the following link:

Regarding Mid-Sem Project Deadline - Extension
by Avinash Gautam . - Wednesday, 6 October 2021, 4:56 PM
  	

Dear Students,

Many of you are traveling to the campus between 07-17th Oct 2021 and as per the AUGSD guidelines, no evaluation should be conducted during this time.  After that, the mid-sem exams are starting therefore we have decided to postpone the deadline for the mid-sem project submission. The extended deadline for the mid-sem project report submission is Nov 08 to Nov 10.

Best wishes,

Avinash

Events on Gather just got way better
Next time you host an event on Gather, you'll see some new things that we think you'll like. Enjoy!
Gather logo

Today we're excited to unveil an entirely revamped pre-event experience! We've dramatically simplified how easy it is to host any event on Gather, whether it's conferences, parties, workshops, networking sessions, or socials. We believe this is a huge step up in event quality and overall Gather experience, and we can't wait for you to see for yourself!
  	  	 

📝 Event Onboarding Flow

From your Gather homepage, you now have an Events tab to showcase all your upcoming events. From Events, select Create Event to jump into our new onboarding flow. 

 

Alternatively, from our Get Started page select Create Space and then Events to access our new onboarding.
A screenshot of the new Gather Events tab available from your Gather homepage. Two events are previewed: Halloweenie Roast, with an image of a fire at night in Gather, and the second Virtual Thanksgiving, with a preview of a large dinner table in Gather. In the Top Nav Menu, a Create Event button displays in the top right corner.
  	  	 

✔️ Host Dashboard and Checklist

We're super excited to now offer event hosts a centralized dashboard that allows you to track progress toward creating and ultimately publishing your event. With a streamlined step-by-step checklist, event management in Gather is now easier than ever. (Keep in mind, an event ≠ reservation. If you'd like to turn your free event into a reservation for 25 or more guests, make sure you go to your dashboard in Step 4 to make a reservation!)
A screenshot of the Events checklist page. Three of the four steps are complete, which is indicated by a progress bar at the top. The Steps are 1, Basic Info; 2, Landing Page; 3, Space Creation; and 4, Space Dashboard. In Step 3, a preview of the Moon pond template in Gather displays.

🛬 Event Landing Pages

The event attendee experience is also about to improve dramatically! Events now come with custom landing pages, complete with event details and the ability to join, save, share, and add events to your personal calendar.

 

We also created a set of instructions geared toward new users that will always display on the landing page. Now everyone can come to the event familiar with the basics and equipped with the right tools! 
A screenshot of the Events landing page. An image preview shows the silhoutte of a man walking down a street full of neon signs. The Event text to the right of the image lists the event title, the date and time of the event, buttons to Add to Calendar, Share, or Save, and a button to Join Event. Further down is a block of text under Event Details, followed by a section titled
  	  	 

📢 Information Board

You can now pin messages on an Information Board if you are a Moderator or Owner (with the exception of remote work Spaces; see more details in our Help Center). Keep your eye out for live announcements, which will let you broadcast real-time notifications to the entire Space. Coming soon!
A screenshot of the large game room template in Gather. In the Left Nav Menu, the pushpin icon is outlined in red, and the Information Board is showing the Pinned Messages section. There is no current pinned message.

Announcing our Series B and Why the Metaverse Matters
The Metaverse matters because it will create unprecedented access to opportunity for people, no matter where they are.
Gather logo

 

 

Today we are thrilled to announce that we’ve raised $50 million in Series B funding, led by Sequoia and Index Ventures! This is a huge milestone for us and we’re excited that our investors share our vision of the best way to build the Metaverse.

 

At Gather, we believe the Metaverse matters because it will create meaningful human connection and unprecedented access to opportunity for hundred of millions, if not billions of people, no matter where they are.

 

While the Metaverse is still very early, it isn’t a far-off sci-fi future—it’s already happening today, with Gather. Read more about Why the Metaverse Matters, from our CEO and

Co-Founder, Phillip Wang.

 

With backing from investors such as Sequoia, Index Ventures, Dylan Field (CEO of Figma), Jeff Weiner’s Next Play Ventures (Chairman and former CEO of LinkedIn), Y Combinator, and many others, we are just getting started!

 

Thanks for being a part of this journey.

Dear Students

Some you are not able to find partners for Assignment #1!

I will be sharing their information in this space. Currently, I have one such student who is not able to find partners. 

1. Lingesh Kumar - 2018B4A70857P

If any "group" has less than 3 members,  they can reach out to Lingesh directly!

I will  keep adding students here who are facing problems in forming groups

Gather November Updates: We're So Thankful for Everything! 
Next time you head to Gather, there will be some shiny, new-and-improved features waiting for you!
Gather logo
Two rooms in a Gather Space. The room on the left has dark grey-blue carpet, three red couches and a coffee table, with an avatar in a wheelchair in the doorway. The room on the right has wood floors. A tree with pink leaves sits in the middle of the room. An avatar on the far right is approaching a bulletin board. Another avatar is dancing near a yellow couch. An avatar in a red hat is walking toward another avatar dancing next to the pink tree.

Hey there! Happy November! 

We don't know about you, but many of us at Gather are ready to curl up with warm beverages next to a fireplace. But regardless of where we are—the temperature is always just right in our Gather office!

We brewed some great changes in Gather throughout October. If you missed the Monday updates to our changelog, here's the TL;DR version for your inbox:
  	  	 
💃 New Event Set-Up in Gather

Create Space? Check. Invite attendees? Check. Have an awesome time? Triple check!

 

Create your next Gather event in 4 steps with our new event creation system. When done, you'll have a beautiful event landing page where guests can preview event details, add the event to their calendar, share it on social media, or save it for later. Best of all, you can change your event details or the Space you're using without having to change your event link!

 

Just open your Gather homepage, select the Events tab, and select Create Event in the upper right corner. (Keep in mind that creating an event is not the same as creating a reservation! For events with 25+ attendees, make a reservation in

Step 4.)
A view of the new Events tab on your Gather homepage. Three previews of events display: Virtual Thanksgiving, White Elephant Gift Exchange, and Event in Progress. Virtual Thanksgiving shows a preview of a dining room in Gather. White Elephant Gift Exchange shows a living room in Gather. The Event in Progress shows a generic Gather logo background. Progress bars display beneath each event.

You'll be guided through a checklist to make sure you have everything you need to be ready for your event!
A view of the new events checklist in Gather. A progress bar dynamically shows completion at the top of the page. Step 1 is Basic Info, Step 2 is Landing Page, and Step 3 is Space Creation. Each step has a button for action.
Create an event
  	  	 

🔊 Video Volume Sliders

You can now adjust the volume of others on a person-by-person basis! This highly requested feature is available on our browser and desktop application. You can even adjust the volume of shared audio from a shared screen separately from the person who's screen-sharing!
  	  	 

📝 Information Board Updates

You can now update your Information Board while inside of your Space as a Moderator or Owner. You can also add links inside of your announcement text! (Note: Information Boards are not available in remote work Spaces.)
View of the Information Board in a Gather game room template. A red outline is drawn around the Information Board icon in the Left Nav Menu. A modal displays any pinned messages, although there are not any displaying. The modal provides buttons to Manage messages and create New post.
  	  	 
📲 Mobile Updates
Two mobile screenshots side by side. The screenshot on the left shows an action bar at the top of the screen with a green camera button to turn off video. The screenshot on the right shows a preview of a shared screen.

Improve general performance on mobile and reduce battery usage with our new
Prioritize Audio toggle! This setting turns off incoming video streams and replaces them with their character icons. To expand an individual video stream, just select someone's name or shared screen.

Subject: Batch Snaps 2021 | Tentative Dates and Announcement
From: "Mail Admin @ Pilani Campus" <mailadmin@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>

To: Students at Pilani Campus <students@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in>

Greetings from Student Alumni Relations Cell!

We understand that Batch Snaps and the Yearbook are an integral part of every BITSian’s Life and capture the nostalgic memories of the graduating batch. The eventful years spent on the campus with seniors, batchmates and juniors turn into lifelong friendships. The Yearbook and Photos are what capture these memories for years to come.

Traditionally, the Batch Snaps are held in the second semester of your pre-final year. However, due to COVID, they were not organized for the past two years. With things being normalized and students back on campus, the Student Alumni Relations Cell is elated to announce that we are organizing the Batch Snaps for FD Batch of 2018 (Single Degree and Dual Degree Students), HD Batch of 2020 and MBA Batch of 2020, tentatively on 19th, 20th and 21st November 2021 (Friday, Saturday and Sunday).

This has been planned after extensive discussion and proper permissions from the administration and Director. According to your branch, they will be organized in slots, and every student participating in the Batch Snaps will have to strictly follow all mandated guidelines. A comprehensive document will be soon shared with detailed instructions, guidelines and schedule. This mail has been sent so that students can plan their leaves accordingly if they wish to participate in the Batch Snaps.

The snaps will be organized on the dates mentioned above unless communicated otherwise due to unavoidable circumstances. Please note that you would be only allowed to enter the venue in your designated slots, and this will be organized just for the students of the graduating batch who are on campus.

We are aware that some 2018 FD Single Degree Students are on PS-2. For such students, we would probably organize them next semester if the conditions allow. Please find attached a Document with some frequently asked questions.


We encourage you to contact the undersigned if you have any other doubts:

Yash Thakker: +91 9725791724

Vidushi Sahay: +91 9871941631

Dear all,

Greetings. I am delighted to announce that BITS Pilani is among the 30 institutions selected to participate in the GATI (Gender Advancement for Transforming Institutions) project of DST, towards the journey of creating an ecosystem to build competencies and adopting best practices and pathways for transformational changes with focus on gender equity and women empowerment.

Project GATI pilots a sustainable self-assessment and accreditation model. The institute would be required to create SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound) action plans for systemic and cultural transformations. A metric-based self-assessment application followed by peer review would be employed to establish how well the principles of the GATI charter have been imbibed in the institutional framework through outcome focused initiatives.

We are looking forward to the partnership with Athena SWAN UK and GATI India to (i) identify gaps, systemic barriers and structural factors which need attention; (ii) adopt best practices & strategic plans; and (iii) implement policy level decisions to create an enabling, non-intimidating environment, organizational culture especially for women in STEMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine and Mathematics) disciplines in all stages of their career progression.

The institute leadership and GATI Self-Assessment Team (GSAT) with the support of you all will be working in a mission mode towards this initiative. Please visit  www.bits-pilani.ac.in/gati  for more details on the GATI initiative.

I am sure your wholehearted and enthusiastic participation in this journey of transformation would make it a beacon of gender equity in higher education institutes.   

 

Best wishes,
