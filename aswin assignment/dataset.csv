Dear Students,
As I am travelling out of India to deliver an invited talk in Aditya Birla Group Senior Manufacturing Leaders Technology Conference series “REPRISM 2019” (Reinforcing Engineering Pride & Recognizing Innovative Seamless Manufacturing – a celebration for manufacturing professionals), so I will  not be engaging Thermodynamics course classes for Lecture Section 1 in this week i.e. on 14th and 16th August. We will have extra class sometime next week to compensate the same. I will be back on Sunday i.e. 18th August 2019. However my tut class will be engaged by some other instructor.

Instructions for Latecomers in Lecture Classes (Section 3, Aakash Chand Rai)
  	

Dear students,


1)  DON'T ENTER THE CLASS AT YOUR OWN WISH.

2) Patiently wait outside the class - I will let you in (once there is a sufficiently large group) after 5-10 minutes.

I again urge you to avoid coming late to the class since it creates disturbance for me and the students. I also request your full cooperation in this matter, and hope this helps to maintain discipline in the class, especially at the beginning of the lectures.

Best regard,

  Dear students,
   If you are facing some difficulty in understanding the basic concepts of first year courses (which may be due to the pace of the class/instructor or language problem) and need help then we will try to arrange some remedial classes. The purpose of these classes will be to clear the basic concepts and not an advanced level discussion on topics. Please reply to me asap by mentioning the details of the course and the kind of help required by tomorrow 5.00 PM.

I bet you all are frustrated with untidy rooms and shitty cleaning services and their prices.
What do you all think about a subscription to cleaning. It would be including plans like.

1  Sunday only
2. Thrice a week
3. Every day

All the plans would be affordable as you are signing for a complete month at once. Workers will be good.
There'll be few time slots....you can choose according to your class timings.

Fill this google form and share your precious views with me. It would be a great help for me.

Dear Students,

The second revision class is scheduled on Tuesday (24th September) at 6 PM in Room No. 5102, in which chapter 11 and a part of chapter 14 will be revised. Remaining part of chapter 14 will be done in a revision class on Friday.

I know it is a very busy time for you due to number of things like many students will appear in thermo. test at 5 PM on Tuesday. But that is the life at BITS which makes you learn and prepare for future challenges. So accept it happily, and energize yourself  to manage the time and challenges. 

It is not easy for teachers also. For instance, I will be teaching for 3 hours on Tuesday before I reach your class at 6 PM. It is because I would be busy in official meetings and other works on Wednesday and Thursday ....

See you,

Greetings!

I hope your comprehensive exam preparations are going well. The last few days till the exams commence are essential for revisiting the topics and for making the concepts concrete. I have thereby compiled various academic resources including concept map, chapter review, lecture slides, PDFs of textbooks, reference and lecture videos.

This drive mostly contains resources which are not available on SU app.To give a little assistance, I have compiled class notes made by many brilliant 2018 batch students who have done exceptionally well in the courses for which their notes have been given. There was a very popular demand for this initiative last year. Therefore, I felt a need to implement this for our fresher batch, especially for CP and General Biology as class notes are the most integral part for these examinations. This link also contains the new workshop manual, since it is very hard to find. It also contains some of the current year's physics lab comprehensive exam answer sheets to help the students who are yet to give the exam. I assure you that the material provided in this link is reliable, however it is not a substitute for class attendance or self study. I suggest you to use these notes as a supplement and not your only means of preparation. This drive will be regularly updated throughout the academic year to give continuous assistance to the students.I hope the hard work you’ve put in helps you to ace the ensuing exams.


Feel free to contact if you require any further assistance. 

 Regards

Hello Bitsians,

 

We are launching the BITS Time-Table Visualizer. It is a customized web-app to view and resolve clashes. You can select the courses you would like to view your timetable according to your preference.


The web-app will save a lot of time and is a better alternative to filling your phone with timetable apps for just a few days while also wasting storage space!


Link for a Web app - BITS Time-table Visualizer (desktop view only)


The web-app creates fancy time-table(s) when one enters the fields and it is easy to use also.

 

With this feature, you can not only save your timetable in an organized way but also make your pre-registration sample timetable(s) and can see if there are any clashes between courses. Hence, it can make your Registration procedure easy.


Tentative Time-Table is attached below. 

 

We hope this initiative helps you with your registration.

Dear All,

Happy new year! 

Now you are already experienced about studies and preparation of exams in BITS Pilani. Yet I felt the need to share some tips with you for the study of Probability and Statistics course that can help you a lot to have the real feel and learning of this important course. 

First you must know and realize very quickly that this course is very very important course having enormous applications in every discipline of science and engineering. For doing any advance course in statistics, this course is a pre-requisite. Feel it a lifetime opportunity to learn this basic and elementary course. So feel yourself motivated to learn the concepts in this course as deep as possible. Once you start listening and reading it carefully,  it is very easy to understand. Trust me you will enjoy it with fun! 

Now I tell you a short/direct path to reach the level of real learning and enjoyment in this course. First read the notes at the link Chapter 2  word by word, and try to learn all the definitions/concepts cleanly. Try to visualize there how things are developed one after the other. These notes are exclusively prepared for your use. These notes carry nice flow of the development of probability concepts in pedagogical and concise manner. Section 2.1 requires only one careful reading to get an idea of the main objective of the course. After that starting from random experiment learn all the definitions/concepts with examples. Do all the examples in writing with understanding of the concepts. I have taught these notes in the first four lectures in the LTC. So you can also listen the impartus lectures to understand these notes conveniently. If still you face any difficulties in understanding something there, you can write me or come to my office 6165-O around 5 PM on any day (except Saturday and Sunday). I will be happy to help you.

These days, I am working on the Chapter 3 where I am trying to give a crisp and clear demonstration of all the discrete probability distributions. I am sure you will enjoy this stuff...
 
I may not be here tomorrow but my words of motivation will always be with you... Will stay in touch with you..

Cheers! 

Suresh

Dear All,

Many students did not turn up in the recent couple of LTC classes. Probably, they are busy in preparing for quiz etc. But I would like to suggest them not to miss the lecture classes because it can badly affect their conceptual understanding of this course. Learning the ongoing Chapter 3 with clarity is important as it lays the foundation for remaining chapters in this course.

It is well known that no scientist or engineer is complete without statistics. I wish you to be the best in the world. So do not let this opportunity go. Hope you will plan your preparation for the quiz etc. wisely such that you do not miss the classes of this important course, in any case.

This week, after doing a couple of more probability distributions, I will present a summary of this chapter so that you can visualize development of this whole chapter at one go.

See you.

    It is well known that no scientist or engineer is complete without statistics. I wish you to be the best in the world. So do not let this opportunity go. Hope you will plan your preparation for the quiz etc. wisely such that you do not miss the classes of this important course, in any case.

    This week, after doing a couple of more probability distributions, I will present a summary of this chapter so that you can visualize development of this whole chapter at one go.

    See you.

        Dear All,

        Happy new year! 

        Now you are already experienced about studies and preparation of exams in BITS Pilani. Yet I felt the need to share some tips with you for the study of Probability and Statistics course that can help you a lot to have the real feel and learning of this important course. 

        First you must know and realize very quickly that this course is very very important course having enormous applications in every discipline of science and engineering. For doing any advance course in statistics, this course is a pre-requisite. Feel it a lifetime opportunity to learn this basic and elementary course. So feel yourself motivated to learn the concepts in this course as deep as possible. Once you start listening and reading it carefully,  it is very easy to understand. Trust me you will enjoy it with fun! 

        Now I tell you a short/direct path to reach the level of real learning and enjoyment in this course. First read the notes at the link Chapter 2  word by word, and try to learn all the definitions/concepts cleanly. Try to visualize there how things are developed one after the other. These notes are exclusively prepared for your use. These notes carry nice flow of the development of probability concepts in pedagogical and concise manner. Section 2.1 requires only one careful reading to get an idea of the main objective of the course. After that starting from random experiment learn all the definitions/concepts with examples. Do all the examples in writing with understanding of the concepts. I have taught these notes in the first four lectures in the LTC. So you can also listen the impartus lectures to understand these notes conveniently. If still you face any difficulties in understanding something there, you can write me or come to my office 6165-O around 5 PM on any day (except Saturday and Sunday). I will be happy to help you.

        These days, I am working on the Chapter 3 where I am trying to give a crisp and clear demonstration of all the discrete probability distributions. I am sure you will enjoy this stuff...
         
        I may not be here tomorrow but my words of motivation will always be with you... Will stay in touch with you..

        Cheers! 

        Suresh

Regarding the solution of Q4 of mid-sem test
  	
PDF document Other Solution of Q.4.pdf

Dear All,

Q4 in the mid-semester exam can be solved by multiple methods. One of the possible solution is delta to Y conversion (or Y to delta conversion) of the load as mentioned in the model solution uploaded on Nalanda by 5th March, 20. Without any Y-delta conversion, the problem can be solved by calculating the line currents for delta load and Y load individually. Final IaA (also IbB, IcC) can be calculated by adding the two line-current components. However, this 2nd method has no conflict with the syllabus attached in the notice before mid-sem. The alternate solution of Q4 with individual line current measurement technique has been attached for your reference.

Therefore, the delta-Y conversion was discussed in lecture classes’ couple of times.  Also, problem number 4.65 based on Y-delta conversion for three-phase load was discussed in tutorial classes’ on 27th and 29th February 2020. So, the concept of delta-Y conversion is a well-discussed method for this course.

    Equity Research Initiative
    by
    Mentored-Research
    in collaboration with
    Wall Street Club, BITS Pilani and Finance Comittee, Placement Unit

 

    Mentored-Research is proud to present its flagship program – the Equity Research Initiative (ERI); a 6-week internship-cum-training program designed to train students to perform an educated analysis of equities.

    In operations since 2010, ERI has equipped students from the top colleges of India, including the likes of BITS Pilani, IIT Kharagpur, NIT Trichy, BIT Mesra, VJTI Mumbai, Lady Shri Ram College (Delhi University), etc in the art of equity research.

    Students are taught how to analyze businesses and their respective sectors, screen for comparable companies, read financial statements, use ratio analysis techniques, and construct valuation models. Done right, this will gives students an understanding and insight into the business of the company and its performance relative to industry benchmarks. Students complete the program by compiling their analysis into a stock pitch video, giving them invaluable soft skills. In course of this program, students are also given the opportunity to interact and network with several finance professionals via live online chat sessions.

    Further, students who successfully complete the course will receive a certificate of completion. Beyond the 6 weeks of interactive learning, such a certification will undoubtedly be a lucrative resume addition for any student inclined towards finance, investment banking, stock markets, business consultancy and related avenues.

    Requirements

    There are no pre-requisites to this program, with the only requirements being a passion to broaden your horizons and a willingness to learn.  


        Fundamental Analysis
        Financial Modeling using MS-Excel
        Valuation Techniques
        Equity Research
        Stock Pitch
        Interactive sessions with experienced industry experts


        Introduction to Ms-Excel
        Introduction to Stock Markets and Investing
        Fundamental Analysis
        Ratio Analysis
        Discounted Cash Flow Valuation
        Relative Valuation

    To get a brief idea about the program, check out this video!

Dear students,

Hope all of you have started preparing your assignment as per the instructions provided. Once you complete the handwritten solution along with the excel-screenshot for Q 11, please scan the whole document and save it in a single pdf file.  

To facilitate the online submission of your assignment (scanned pdf), your respective tutorial instructor is creating a link through ""Google Classroom"". Once the link is created (you will be notified by e-mail), you have to submit your assignment through the google class platform. Specifically, in the google class dedicated to your section, your instructor will create an assignment component where you should upload your pdf file. However, please note that you will be allowed to submit the assignment only once, and after submission, you can not edit or replace it. Therefore, please take care of any manual or technical errors before submission. In addition, please note that e-mail submission will not be considered.

Dear All,

Hope you and your family members are fine and doing well in this unexpected time of crisis due to pandemic. I am sure this difficult time will pass soon with our strength of patience and awareness, and we will meet soon on the campus again with the same cheer and joy.

Many students have asked for my advice regarding the compre option. There are many things to ponder about the compre exam. First, we do not know its time. It may be very near to your next sem exams. Next, out of 45%, it would carry at least 20% open book or  it may be completely open book depending on the situation.  

Considering the above points, in my opinion, you should not opt for the compre exam. The students who have really bad precompre score and are very confident of scoring in open book part of compre exam, may think about the compre option. In my opinion, the compre exam would not create a big difference in your grades rather you will loose the benefit of precompre grading in case you are not able to do well in the compre. You know that scoring in open book exam could be very difficult. So I will suggest all of you not to burden yourself with the compre exam. Forget it, chill and utilize your focus and energy for the courses of the next semester. In case you opt for compre exam, you will always be engaged and worried about the compre exam till it is over. This may badly affect your performance in the next sem courses. 

In conclusion, in my opinion, you should not burden yourself with the compre exam because I do not see any big advantage rather it could be an disadvantage for you due to the reasons I mentioned above.

Cheers,

Suresh

    Dear All,

    Happy new year! 

    Now you are already experienced about studies and preparation of exams in BITS Pilani. Yet I felt the need to share some tips with you for the study of Probability and Statistics course that can help you a lot to have the real feel and learning of this important course. 

    First you must know and realize very quickly that this course is very very important course having enormous applications in every discipline of science and engineering. For doing any advance course in statistics, this course is a pre-requisite. Feel it a lifetime opportunity to learn this basic and elementary course. So feel yourself motivated to learn the concepts in this course as deep as possible. Once you start listening and reading it carefully,  it is very easy to understand. Trust me you will enjoy it with fun! 

    Now I tell you a short/direct path to reach the level of real learning and enjoyment in this course. First read the notes at the link Chapter 2  word by word, and try to learn all the definitions/concepts cleanly. Try to visualize there how things are developed one after the other. These notes are exclusively prepared for your use. These notes carry nice flow of the development of probability concepts in pedagogical and concise manner. Section 2.1 requires only one careful reading to get an idea of the main objective of the course. After that starting from random experiment learn all the definitions/concepts with examples. Do all the examples in writing with understanding of the concepts. I have taught these notes in the first four lectures in the LTC. So you can also listen the impartus lectures to understand these notes conveniently. If still you face any difficulties in understanding something there, you can write me or come to my office 6165-O around 5 PM on any day (except Saturday and Sunday). I will be happy to help you.

    These days, I am working on the Chapter 3 where I am trying to give a crisp and clear demonstration of all the discrete probability distributions. I am sure you will enjoy this stuff...
     
    I may not be here tomorrow but my words of motivation will always be with you... Will stay in touch with you..

    Cheers!

Dear Student


For some of the students, Instructors for Lecture hours and Common Hour are different, which should not happen for this course. 


Hence, you are suggested to attend all the classes of the same Instructor to which you are registered for Lecture hour.

Hello Guys

Some of you are asking about the meeting link for tomorrow's class.

It is the same link which was sent for the first lecture and it is going to be the same  throughout the semester.


Today's tutorial ( converted to a lecture) link was valid for today only.

Very soon we will also send separate meeting links for individual tutorial sections.

Guys

Some of you are sending requests for skipping tomorrow's class. 

We are already lagging behind the schedule, please don't ask for that.

What we can do is to not start a new chapter. It will be just a revision, doubts clearing / discussion session.

 attend the tutorial no. 1.  Those among you all who are assigned tutorial section 5 should attend tutorial section 2.
 We will send the seperate online link for each section soon.

Dear all,

The study materials with the manual for the first experiment is shared through google drive. Sample dataset is given so that you may complete your report and upload the same. The platform for uploading will be most probably either in Canvas or Google classroom. The platform details will be shared to you soon. In the meantime you can work on the lab records and keep it ready for submission. 
Since, we are running on online mode with the help of various platforms, the things will be settled by this week and can run smoothly thereafter.
The deadline for submission of lab records for the first experiments is extended till the upcoming sunday(i.e. 06/9/2020) so that you will get enough time for doing the calculations and submission of lab records. But from the next experiments on wards, the understanding is that, you have to submit the lab records before the next upcoming lab class.


We are thinking of conducting a demo quiz tomorrow before we have the real one(for the 1st lab experiment). The details will be mailed to you soon.




With best regards,
Harikrishnan

Evaluative will be based on research methods only. Please search the topic of research as per your interest in Psychology related areas. For example, media, social issues, education, behavioural concerns etc, but it should be connected with psychology as behaviour, attitude, perception, etc. The areas are not limited to these areas only ( these are just examples).
Narrow the area and then start searching for one which attracts your attention. You are advised to explore on your own. 

You have to read on the methodology aspect connected to the topic (problem statement) as mentioned. The questions will be related to the design of the study and the portion covered in class.

Points to be noted
  	


- Queries about the content of the course, the lecture will be resolved through email if the doubt still remains but a day or two prior to the test, the questions related to the content of the question paper (syllabus) will not be entertained to avoid exclusive information dissemination. 

- Queries related to only instructions or mode of conduction will be answered over email, but content-specific questions such as approval of research problem, methodology etc would not be before the test. To be fair and just with all the students and avoid any unjust behaviour by sharing exclusive information to a specific student. 

- In the light of the above points, discussion in class is encouraged to facilitate mutual learning.

Due to some unavoidable reasons, I will not be able to conduct today's class. 

However, I received your feedback from the SFC. I am  sorry, as I am  engaged in admission activities which are still in process, there is a communication gap between us. 
Whatever may be the reason, I consider myself responsible for this.
 I'm really thankful for the feedback and I will try my best to rectify it in the coming lectures and tests.

Cognition
  	

Dear students, 

Some of the students had difficulty in viewing the following videos in class today due to network issues. Kindly view the shared links to understand cognition and cognitive development. 

Cognition includes activities and processes concerned with the acquisition, storage, retrieval and processing of knowledge. These help us perceive, attend, remember, think, reason, decide, communicate and so on. 

 Scientists at the Primate Research Center tried to understand the cognitive development in humans and chimpanzees. Humans developed social and language capabilities. Recent cognition and behaviour studies have mentioned that chimpanzees are good at capturing images rapidly as a whole, while humans are better at understanding the meaning of what they see. Chimpanzees neglect social context whereas humans are collaborative, altruistic and using language for communication. The theory provides insights, how humans 'traded' some aspects of cognitive development by re-purposing areas of the brain that evolved in the context of other uses.

Reg. Class cancellation(28/10/2020) and few other important points
  	

Dear all,


Today's(28/10/2020) lecture class is cancelled. Please use the old google meet link (given below) for the upcoming lecture class from Friday onwards.


The mid-semester grading has been calculated based on Test1, Test2, lab experiment record marks(for exp.1 and exp.2) and best 1 out of 3 lab quizzes(total of 80 marks).

There will not be any lab quiz tomorrow. Instead there will be a lab quiz(Lab Quiz 4) next week(on 4th Nov.). 

Even after repeated warning, some of you are trying to submit the lab records through email. All the problems and error in uploading are due to last minute rush even after providing enough time to submit the lab records. This is strictly discouraged.


Best regards,

Harikrishnan

Dear Students,
The correct answer for this question is 12.49 N-m which was not there in the option and hence correct answer was none of the above.

What is the torque (approx) to be produced in a circular aluminum shaft (μ = 0.32) of length 1.8 m and radius 10 mm to produce a rate of twist of 0.03183 radians/m. Assume E = 66 GPa

Dear Students,
Please find the marks of Test 2 and Tutorial test on bending attached herewith.

Dr. Faizan will inform you about the test 3 details.

One more test on the syllabus of test 1 and test 2 will be conducted as a make up for test 1 and test 2. As the next two weeks are going to be very busy with the tests and submission of other subjects as well as comprehensive examinations of the previous semester, I am planning to conduct the make up test on 14 /11/2020.

Best 2 out of test1, test 2 and makeup will be considered.

Please give the suggestions.

                Please find the marks of Test 2 and Tutorial test on bending attached herewith.

                Dr. Faizan will inform you about the test 3 details.

                One more test on the syllabus of test 1 and test 2 will be conducted as a make up for test 1 and test 2. As the next two weeks are going to be very busy with the tests and submission of other subjects as well as comprehensive examinations of the previous semester, I am planning to conduct the make up test on 14 /11/2020.

                Best 2 out of test1, test 2 and makeup will be considered.

                Please give the suggestions.

                Best Wishes

Hi ASWIN,

Announcement
	
T3 Model Answers. Also, I will discuss the solution in tomorrow's class. Some people have got zero for plagiarism. Plagiarism is the worst thing one can do in a test like this. I have always trusted my students. I would strongly urge each of you not to do anything that breaks my trust on my students now, which might have repercussion in the future also. You don't have to perform at any cost. Sometimes it is ok not to get good marks. But, please do not use short cuts to gain success. It will never help anyone in the long run.

        Dear Students,

        One more test on the syllabus of test 1 and test 2 will be conducted as a make up for test 1 and test 2. As the next two weeks are going to be very busy with the tests and submission of other subjects as well as comprehensive examinations of the previous semester, I am planning to conduct the make up test on 14 /11/2020.

        Best 2 out of test1, test 2 and makeup will be considered.

        Please give the suggestions.

Dear All, 
Please check your marks on Nalanda in the next one hour. some points are given below.
Regarding Section 1 of the comprehensive exam.
1. It is possible that the students may see the score on aws.nalanda more than the one shown on Dashboard (bits-pilani.ac.in) This because of the negative marking scheme for section 1. Please go through the test properly and then only write back to me if you have any query.
2.There are around 23 students who never submitted the test. Fortunately I could extract their submission from Nalanda and manually done their evaluations hence these students may not be able to see the evaluation on Nalanda.
3. Answer sheets submitted in google drive as well as on Nalanda are evaluated. Those who submitted on Nalanda can see the answer sheet there only. You may be able to see some remarks also with the answer sheet.
4.Answer sheets submitted through email are not evaluated as it was announced well in advance to upload the answer sheets on Nalanda only and form Dummy test was also provided, unfortunately very few students attempted the dummy test.  However, I have checked the answer sheets uploaded on google drive also.
5. Post comprehensive average is 136.88 and comprehensive average is 18.51.
6. If there is any genuine doubt then only write to me.
7. It is difficult for me to share the answer sheets summitted on google drive.
8. Soon you will be able to see the answers on aws.Nalanda
9. Uploading of the marks is in progress wait.

Thanking you  




    Dear Students,
    Please find the marks of Test 2 and Tutorial test on bending attached herewith.

    Dr. Faizan will inform you about the test 3 details.

    One more test on the syllabus of test 1 and test 2 will be conducted as a make up for test 1 and test 2. As the next two weeks are going to be very busy with the tests and submission of other subjects as well as comprehensive examinations of the previous semester, I am planning to conduct the make up test on 14 /11/2020.

    Best 2 out of test1, test 2 and makeup will be considered.

    Please give the suggestions.

    Best Wishes
    Sachin

Sir,

     Today I waited 10 min for students to join as very few were there in the beginning. Next time I will start from 8 AM. I could not cover all 7 problems today. I am attaching list of problems and solutions for practice at home. I will upload in NALANDA.

Dear Students,
there was a small error in the derivation of temperature distribution in cylinder. Corrected version is attached with this mail.Please refer this instead of the one derived in the class. It is self explanatory. It was mentioned in the chat box, but i did not notice it. Please feel free to unmute and speak in case of any query.
Best wishes

Dear students,

Sorry for informing you late. 
Kindly note that still I have not reached campus due to some change in travel plan, so today's Mechanisms and Machines class will remain suspended.
The common hour on Monday 8th Feb will be engaged as a regular class where we'll complete our discussion on Velocity diagrams and start Acceleration analysis.
Based on your feedback, If required then I'll engage one extra class before 15th Feb (Monday Tutorial hour).
As announced, on 15th Feb probably, we'll take our first evaluative tutorial.

Thanks Chandraveer@for being TA in the course and explaining AutoCAD basic concepts. Chandraveer was CT of the course last year and may engage one or two more sessions on MATLAB coding once we'll complete the velocity and acceleration analysis probably sometimes after your Midsem exams

best wishes

Dear Students,

Before writing the instructions, I want to clear one thing the course is running only for two sections (L1 and L2) and fifteen tutorial sections (T2 to T16). The L3 section and T1 tutorial section is for those newly joined 2020 batch students who will enter their second semester in March 2021. In the timetable, it is clearly mentioned that the instructor is decided it means those sections are not currently running.

For those who have added into L3 and T1, that is by mistake and this concern we have raised to the concerned authorities and will soon resolve. For all students, the regular class days are MWF and tutorial class on Tuesday at 8 AM. Therefore, the tut test as mentioned in the course handout will surely be conducted on 9th Feb 2021 at 8 AM. 

The canvas invite link and other quiz specific instructions will be shared with you by tomorrow. You need to accept the invite link and you will be added to the course. The link may be sent by end of the day so wait for it. During tut-test, you need to keep your Video and Audio ON. Your attendance and movement will be watched as per the instructions by AUGSD. 

Please do not ask to relax any instruction. 

All the best

Dear students,

 

Kindly note that Chandraveer will engage Monday 15th Feb tutorial class (8 to 9 AM). This will be his second session on AutoCAD. He will discuss the steps to draw acceleration diagrams of 1-2 problems in AutoCAD.


I have requested Chandraveer to engage one more session on MATLAB coding after we complete the analytical part of four bar mechanisms, that would be probably after your Mid Sem exams. I wish all the students will participate and make the best use of these sessions.



Thanks Chandraveer for sparing time to guide juniors.

Hello Everyone, 
                           Due to some unavoidable circumstances, I won't be able to conduct tutorial session tomorrow in the morning. I will arrange a compensatory class work in a couple of days.

Dear Students,
We will have a problem solving session on Transient conduction on 17/02/2021 tutorial class. It will not be evaluative as we have not done any practice problems.However, students are strongly suggested to attend the session as we will not have any other problem solving session for Conduction Heat Transfer anymore.
best wishes
P Srinivasan

Dear students,

Note a few more points along with correction to point 7 in the previous email.

 

No Matlab/Python/excel OR any such tools for calculation purpose.



§  Instead of converting AUTOCAD files to PDF files, you have to submit the snippets of velocity and acceleration diagrams for the Graphical Analysis question. For reference, you can view the solution of the First tutorial test uploaded on Nalanda AWS.

§  Tabulate the velocity and acceleration answers on paper, and submit them through the QR Code Scanner option.

§  Mention as many dimensions as possible. No clarifications/requests regarding the same will be accepted once the examination ends.

Dear Students,



    All the questions are compulsory
    Sections sequencing is fixed so you need to attempt each section one by one and one after the other in a set sequence. You cannot skip any section, however, you can leave the questions unanswered. 
    You will get 105 minutes in total to complete the exam and upload.
    The first section (Part A) is timed and you need to complete all the questions in Part A within the first 40 minutes. The type of questions and their weightage will get to know at the time of the exam. Please do not ask through separate emails. 
    The remaining time is for Part B and Part C consisting of two questions in each part. The suggestion is to allocate the remaining time equally to both sections carrying equal weightage where you need to upload your answers while writing their explanation on the space provided.

    Do not forget to write your Name, ID number, course number, and date on each page of your answer sheet. To get the full score, you need to show all the steps required to arrive at the final answer with proper interpretation.
    All questions are self-explanatory, so write your answer as per your understanding of the question as per the class discussion.
    Online browsing will not be tolerated. If any student will be found with the browsing, her/his paper will not be evaluated. Remember, we are also looking at your screen.
    Don't send your answer sheets to my email during or after the exam. It will not be considered. Please do not ask for this. This is as per the AUGSD guidelines. 
    The Mid-Sem test is Open Book and you can access any study material, provided they are not surfing the internet.
    This evaluative component is proctored so read the Mettl instructions carefully and be alert because you will be watched each time by the invigilators. Please concentrate on your exam only and cooperate with the proctor.


    Please adhere to the guidelines of AUGSD & Timetable related to the Mercer Mettl Platform. Please be ready with all the necessary technology specified by the AUGSD/Timetable for giving an exam on the Mettl platform.
    Be alert and join as per the instructions given while your training on Mettl.
    Please ensure no disturbances during the exam time. Please ensure the highest ethics and maintain the decorum of the exam.


    For those who are not able to join, wait for some time and try after a minute. Don't worry, your time will start once you enter into the exam window.
    For those who are not able to receive the OTP wait for some time, refresh your email inbox, and get it.
    Still, after few minutes you are not getting OTP then click on the link again for getting a new OTP. Do all those things patiently. 
    You can also get 504 error for which wait for some time to connect or again join using the link and new OTP.
    If you disconnect in between because of internet connectivity at your place and if you come out from Mettl by the system itself then wait for the connection and then again log into the system using the link. The link will become inactive for those who didn't join even for a single time. It will remain active for those who join on time and available because of any kind of interruption during the exam time to rejoin.
    Don't be panic. Think patiently and behave. Your time will not go until you successfully login to the system.
    Do the necessary uploading on time. 

All the best
Course Instructors

Dear PoE Students,

Hello Everyone,

Thanks



",Academics

Dear class,

As many of our students are participating in APOGEE, the M&M tutorial class on 22nd March will be engaged as a regular class. No evaluative component tomorrow. We'll continue our discussion on Dynamics of Reciprocating Engine.

All three left out evaluative tutorials will be taken in April. The schedule of those three evaluative tutorials will also be shared before Holi break.

Participate in APOGEE with full of energy and enthusiasm. 

best wishes to you all. 

Dr J S Rathore
Assistant Professor, Dept. of Mech. Engg.

    Dear students, 

    Kindly note that tomorrow's Mechanisms and Machines tutorial hour will be engaged as a Lecture class. Use regular lecture class link (meet.google.com/kqk-qwdn-nvf) to join. Midsem solution key along with marks breakup will be discussed. The discussion on Static Force Analysis will start from Tuesday class onwards.

    thanks

    J S Rathore

Dear Students and Tutors,

This is to inform you all that the tut test 3 which is scheduled to be conducted on 23rd March is now postponed to 30th March 2021 (Tuesday) at 8 AM. This is done by looking at the few topics covered after mid-term and the engagement of few students in APOGEE 21. The test will be conducted on CANVAS in the same pattern. Course students, please be ready with your canvas credentials and practice visiting the course page before the test. 

On 23rd March 2021, the regular combined class will be conducted instead of the tutorial classes. All students are requested to join the regular class links (two for section 1 and two for section 2) at 8 AM on Tuesday. The compensatory tutorial sheet will be distributed with the answers for your practice at home.  

One announcement for those who are not added in NALANDA Course. Please email me for adding you.

Best Wishes

Dear Students,
I have engaged all the classes as per the schedule except on 15/03/2021 due to some other commitments and wanted to take a compensation class today. ( I have not conducted any extra class beyond the scheduled class). However,We may be able to complete the portion as per the schedule. Hence, I wanted to avoid taking this compensation class.
If needed we will have it at a later date.
There will be a lab quiz on Conduction experiment on 30/03/2021 from 4 PM for 10 minutes and submit your conduction lab record by 23 59hrs of 01/04/2021.
Wish you a Happy weekend and Happy Holi.

Dear all,

Hope you are staying safe.

We have compiled an exhaustive list of all Heat Transfer related questions which were asked in GATE and IES (UPSE ESE) in the past three to four years. I am attaching the Word file as well as the PDF file for your convenience.

The final answers are also given at the end of each section if you wish to validate your answers. This can serve as a good revision for the Compre Exam and also if you're interested in attempting GATE / IES in the near future.

In case of any doubts or if you are stuck in any question, feel free to contact any one of the TAs in cc. After a week, we can take some of the tougher questions and discuss them in class.

Kind regards,

Recheck Done, Further Instructions, and Tutorial Class
  	

Dear Students,

Recheck is done and soon you all will receive a report from Mettl on updated status. Question 2(B) is considered for partial marks and is considered for all those who have used the mid-point formula correctlly for both price, quantity, and correct explanation of TR (also checked for those who have not applied for recheck for that question). This is on the basis that at least you know the formula and its application. In case of any further query (not new one) on your recheck request related to part B, kindly contact to Dr. Rajan and he will do the needful but only within 24 hours.  

Don't send any new recheck requests. Those will not be entertained. Those who have submitted their answers on email, their recheck updates will be received in a separate email shortly after this email.

Related to tomorrow's tutorial, there will no tutorial tomorrow instead the practice questions will be taken up by Dr. Krishna in the regular class on Wednesday.  

All the best

Dear Students,
We have completed one semester and the course on Heat Transfer. This courses is offered in II year for the first time. I hope you had a wonderful learning experience and enjoyed the sessions. Tomorrow will be the last lecture of this course for the semester and we will very briefly talk about the different research opportunities and how can pursue your career path in this field if you are interested.
We will have a brief interaction about the courses, coverage and much more importantly your feedback to further improve the teaching and learning process.
I also may plan to offer a course on Power Plant Engineering as an elective, I would like to know the number of students who may be interested in this elective.
I enjoyed teaching this course as we had fruitful discussions and interactions during the session to enhance the learning experience.Some of the session went 45 minutes beyond the class hours. I enjoyed those discussions.
Looking forward to meet you tomorrow.
No PPTs or lecture tomorrow, it will be only discussion.
Please feel free to reach out to me for any doubts/clarification related to the course or any other matter like PS1 if I can resolve/ suggest.
Portion for the comprehensive examination will be all the portion covered after conduction. (Please note, you may need to remember some of the concepts of conduction also to attend the examination.)
All the best.
Stay safe and take care.
We have not met in person. I am sure we will meet sometime in person when you come back to the campus and could recognise your faces. I hope these days will come sooner than later.
Best wishes

Eligibility for the 'Clear' Grade
  	Dear all
The pandemic has wreaked havoc all over the world and the situation is dire in our country at the moment. The whole semester has been fraught with challenges on the physical, psychological, and social levels for the students as well as the faculty. These are unprecedented times especially in your young lives and there is a need for unprecedented measures on various fronts.


    We have introduced a ""Grace Marks Tutorial"" component in which the entire class has been given 10 out of 10 marks. Including this component, now we have a total of 5 tutorials.
    We will consider the best 3 out of these 5 tutorials towards your course total.
    The course Gradebook on Nalanda has already been updated to reflect the above changes.
    Every student whose course total is more than 24 is eligible for applying for the ""Clear"" grade option on the ERP. (Around 97% of the class is now eligible.)


    We are fully aware that some students will opt for writing the comprehensive exam or the make-up exam.
    The grace marks may be a disadvantage for some of these students, in terms of relative grading.
    To address this concern, it has been decided that when we will calculate the ""non-clear"" grades after the comprehensive exam, THE GRACE MARKS TUTORIAL COMPONENT WILL BE REMOVED i.e. the extra marks that have been provided above (ONLY to make the maximum number of students eligible for the ""Clear"" grade) will NOT be considered towards the course total.
    What does this mean for you? You should not overestimate your standing or performance in the course based on the grace marks. It is exclusively meant to enable those who want to opt-out of the final exam to use the ""Clear"" grade option.
    For the final ""non-clear"" grades, we will follow the marking scheme mentioned in the hand-out i.e. we will take the best 3 out of the 4 evaluative tutorials that were actually conducted.
    I understand that you will have further questions about how marks of the students who will opt-out using the ""clear"" grade will be accounted for in the final grading. The AUGSD and the head of the departments have already thought about this issue and have come up with ways to ensure that those who choose to write the exam are not at a loss. Those details will be made available later.

Wish you all the best!

- Dr. Amit R. Singh

Dear Sir,

Hope you & others around you are safe and doing well.

I am Sagar Shorey from the class of 2017. I had moved to the US for my MS in Mechanical Engineering (Energy Systems Track) and completed my coursework in Dec 2020. And it gives me immense pleasure to inform you that I have received and accepted a full-time offer from Clearway Energy, where I will be joining as an Analyst with the Business Development team.

I wanted to express my gratitude for your guidance and support during my time at Pilani and beyond it. It is the fruit of your passion to enlighten students that has provided me with this opportunity to bring about a change in this world and I aim to make the most of it. Your course of Power Plant Engineering set the ball rolling for this trajectory and I am fortunate to have learnt from you.

As I move ahead, please let me know if there are students who have questions about the energy sector or want to study abroad. I hope I can help them just as I received help from my seniors.

I thank you again and wish you great health and happiness!

Sincerely,
Sagar

Instruction for the Tomorrow's (21st May 2021) Comprehensive Exam Scheduled at 3 PM
  	

Dear Students,


    All questions are compulsory
    Part A contains MCQs with No Negative Marking
    Part B contains descriptive/numerical-type questions from the part taught by Dr. Rahul
    Part C contains descriptive/numerical-type questions from the part taught by Dr. Krishna
    Navigation between sections is allowed
    Calculator is allowed
    For Part B and Part C, you need to write your answers in the space provided. You need Not upload your answers separately and no uploading is allowed and available. Please write the main answer in a new line and try to highlight it. We asked questions in such a way that you can manage typing. Also do not forget to explain/interpret your answer. In economics, without interpretation, a number does not have meaning.
    The exam would be of 120 minutes in total. Make sure that in the 120th minute you click the submit/OK button and finish your test.
    Mettl note down your screen activities, your activities, and activities/gadgets present in your room. So please be aware of it and be honest while giving your exam.
    The exam is open book in the sense that you can refer to the slides, e-copy of the textbook during the exam, and other lecture material shared over NALANDA. Any extra material over the internet opened or seen during the exam will be eligible for a penalty in terms of marks. Remember we are looking at your screen activities also.

The syllabus you all knew. The concepts taught post-mid-sem. From the game theory, you can leave the Max-min rule because that requires one class. After the exam, for your information, I would share the two-page notes on this for your learning only.

All the best

Dear Students,
It is nice to connect with you again for an important cause.
ISRO would like to develop technology in certain areas by funding the project as per the attachment. It needs a PI, Co PI and a few interested & motivated students to work on the project for two years. We would like to submit a proposal in the area of Heat Exchanger as per the project number 369 in the attachment.
This mail is to get the willingness of 3-4 students to work on the project if they are interested. I am sure some of you will be keen to work on this project. We have already submitted another proposal on Heat Pipe design in which 4 of your classmates are members of the project.
We hope to get both the projects to work on if sanctioned. You may recall Prof. Chennu has written a book on compact heat exchanger.
If more students express interest, the selection will be made based on the following criteria.
1) CGPA
2) Mark scored in Heat Transfer (PCT) if the student has opted for cleared grade and total marks if they have written the comprehensive examinations. 
3) Interaction with the students
4) Willingness to develop new product and new business venture.
Interested students may mail me directly with the details given above along with a brief resume.
Last date for submission of the proposal is 20 July 2021. Send your details by tomorrow  5PM.
Best wishes
P Srinivasan

Next class - 7/09/2021
  	

Dear Students,

In the next class on Tuesday (7/09/2021), we will be discussing Fuel-air cycle of IC engines. To understand that better it is required that you revise Otto, Diesel and Daul cycles (Air stadard cycles) that you have studied in the previous subjects. You can follow ""Chapter-2 Air-Standard Cycles and Their Analysis "" of the text book V Ganesan or the same topic from other reference books. Please come prepared.

Dear Students

The class for Tuesday second hour will be held at their respective sections.  However, the students registered in T3 and T4 will join in this google meet (meet.google.com/rjt-angi-rew) as Dr. Patel is out of station. The group project progress will be discussed in Tuesday’s class. All the groups will give a small presentation not more than 3 to 4 minutes regarding the progress made in the project. The focus of the presentation should be on work division, material collected, discussion among the group members and another issue. The instructor of each group will give their remarks  after the presentation.

Dear Students

The solution of Tutorial 3 and Tutorial 4 will be discussed in Tuesday’s tutorial class.

There will also be an interaction regarding the progress of the group project that you are doing in the Manufacturing Management course. We know some of you may be travelling. The members who are not travelling should join the meeting and discuss the progress and difficulties (if any). However, if all or most of the members in a group are travelling, they may ask for some other time for interaction with their respective tutorial instructor.

It is non-evaluative. 

With Best Regards

Srikanta Routroy

BITS Embryo is glad to announce 


Jyothi Kalyan Sura


Award-Winning and Critically Acclaimed Technical Director, VFX Artist and Writer

 

as the guest speaker for 3rd Edition of


Being BITSian

                                        An online talk



Taking over the world as a celebrated Technical Director, VFX Artist and Writer he was once walking the same streets as you!
Now, he's back to reveal the wax and wanes of his journey from BITS to Hollywood.


These interactive talks, delivered by the alumni, would most definitely be a special connection to the heart of the attendees. Jyothi will talk about how a BITSian can make use of the various opportunities at the institute to catapult their profiles to be the best in what they aim to do. 

Though this place has evolved a lot, the core feelings and echo of the institute have remained the same over these years. Jyothi will talk about his personal experiences coupled with an informal interaction that would surely benefit all of the BITSians in continuing the legacy. He will also touch upon his career in the film industry and his roles on the celluloid.



Jyothi Kalyan Sura is a storyteller, an engineer, and a leader. 

His love for creative and technical storytelling led him to DreamWorks Animation India, where he worked as a Technical Director (TD) for three years on critically and commercially acclaimed films like How To Train Your Dragon 2, Pokemon Detective Pikachu, X-men Dark Phoenix among others. He left DreamWorks as the only TD to have an artistic demo-reel. Kalyan spent his spare time developing video games, VR, Animation and writing fictional stories - most notably, a 300-page fiction thriller novel, inspired by events in India.

In May 2018, Kalyan completed his Master's in Film Production from USC's prestigious School of Cinematic Arts with a focus on Writing, Directing and Visual Effects. At USC, Kalyan wrote over 15 short films, two feature screenplays and directed five films. He helped over 20 productions in various roles including Sound, Editing and Visual Effects. Kalyan also served as the President of the Visual Effects Society of USC. Possessing a rare blend of technical and creative skills that he can juggle with sophisticated dexterity at will, Kalyan aims to work at the intersection of storytelling and technology.

BITS Embryo warmly welcomes you all!

BITS Embryo

Dear All,

Greetings from Practice School Division.

Practice School is a hallmark of the BITS Curriculum. Practice School is an educational innovation seeking to link industry experience with university instruction. Especially the capstone PS-II Program creates the required setting for experiential learning, by providing students with an opportunity to work on relevant assignments in an industry of their choice, under the guidance of professional experts and the supervision of faculty.

PS Division is happy to announce the release of the 7th edition PS-II Chronicles that is a compilation of student, mentor and faculty experience during PS- II in the second semester of the academic year 2018-19.

The students, industry mentors, and PS-II faculty have come-up with write-ups that offer an insight into the learning experience during PS-II.

The student write-ups are a window into the learning outcomes, the gap between academia and industry, and the day-to-day experiences of students as part of PS-II.

Mentor Write-ups reflect their working experience with BITS Students in all aspects of the student knowledge, academic preparation and work ethics.

PSD hopes that these chronicles will help every reader understand the type of work done by students in PS-II and will provide the necessary feedback path that will help bridge the industry-academia gap.

The chronicle is a must-read for Prospective PS-II Students as this will help understand the work that is happening at various PS Stations and what do the PS-II Mentors look for in terms of skill set.  It will help the student make an informed choice when filling the preference forms. The 7th edition of the PS-II chronicles is attached with this mail.

Thank you

Students' Talk Series 

 Talk No.- 1

""The Earth isn't perfectly round! And why it matters.""

Greetings!

Physics Association is pleased to announce the first talk of the Students' Talk Series this semester by Avinash Sontakke, a 3rd-year student of M.Sc. Physics and B.E. Computer Science Engineering. Avinash did his PS-1 in Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune.


The motion of an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth depends heavily on the gravitational field in which it moves. The mass, shape, and density distribution of the Earth plays a crucial role in determining the gravitational field around it. Using this principle, one can, from the motion of the satellite, computationally arrive at an estimate of the shape of the Earth. The talk will focus on how the gravitational field changes when we deviate from a spherically symmetric Earth and how this new field affects orbiters in space.

Why Robotics & RISS?

 

Robotics-related technologies are becoming ubiquitous and are dominating national headlines due to innovations such as driverless cars, service robots, surgical robots, and aerial vehicles. Robots and the knowledge required to create, operate, and interact with them will become increasingly important to society.

 

The CMU RISS program is designed to immerse students in the world of robotics. Through RISS, students perform research under the mentorship of top scientists in robotics and artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute. RISS works with over 50 research mentors representing a broad range of robotics research (e.g. field robotics, computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence, autonomy, machine learning, graphics, human-robot interaction, and space robotics).

 

The RISS-guided research experience is coupled with powerful professional development and hands-on robotics experiences with industry leaders in a nurturing global community.  The program culminates with an annual research poster session and the publication of the RISS Working Papers Journal. Many students continue to collaborate with RISS mentors, labs, and cohort members.

 

More information about the program, including prior research posters and papers (2019 the RISS Working Papers Journal) can be found here.

Dear All,

Greetings from Practice School Division.

Practice School is a hallmark of the BITS Curriculum. Practice School is an educational innovation seeking to link industry experience with university instruction. Especially the capstone PS-II  program creates the required setting for experiential learning, by providing students with an opportunity to work on relevant assignments in an industry of their choice, under the guidance of professional experts and the supervision of faculty.

PS Division is happy to announce the release of the 8th edition PS-II Chronicles that is a compilation of student, mentor and faculty experience during PS- II in the first semester of the academic year 2019-20.

The students, industry mentors, and PS-II faculty have come-up with write-ups that offer an insight into the learning experience during PS-II.

The student write-ups are a window into the learning outcomes, the gap between academia and industry, and the day-to-day experiences of students as part of PS-II.

Mentor Write-ups reflect their working experience with BITS Students in all aspects of the student knowledge, academic preparation and work ethics.

PSD hopes that these chronicles will help every reader understand the type of work done by students in PS-II and will provide the necessary feedback path that will help bridge the industry-academia gap.

The chronicles are a must-read for Prospective PS-II Students as this will help understand the work that is happening at various PS Stations and what do the PS-II Mentors look for in terms of skill set.  It will help the student make an informed choice when filling the preference forms — the 8th edition of the PS-II chronicles, with this mail.

Thank you

As long as it addresses a clearly defined unmet need of disadvantaged sections of society it will be welcome. However, the group work will be pursued on already identified social challenges unless a team can convince the group that its chosen problem is far more important and urgent.

Experts from CSIR, DBT, DST and other institutions in India and abroad will interact with the participants.

we will form interdisciplinary groups which will collaborate virtually through HBN communities app and bluebutton.org platform   

 



 

Outcome

Five to seven proof of concept, processes, Apps, and service/system design to move from mind to market-social or commercial but preferably openly accessible to users

It is understood that several ideas/products will need considerably more design and fabrication effort to make them useful for the target users/communities. SRISTI is committed to follow up each solution and keep the original group informed and engaged if they so wish. All the solutions will be shared with the user community in open source. In some cases, the defensive patent may be filed to prevent any third party monopolizing the design. SRISTI will have full right to share the solutions developed during summer school to modify, change or improve for the larger social good. The students can come back to follow  up their summer assignment.

Sponsors who may wish to join the efforts are welcome to contact us

 

Fees

SRISTI, which means creation (and the creator), is a developmental voluntary organization set up to strengthen the creativity of grassroots inventors, innovators, school and technology students, and ecopreneurs, biotech start-ups etc.,   engaged in conserving biodiversity, developing eco-friendly educational, technological, cultural or institutional solutions to local problems.  

We want to ensure that every student/faculty who is sincere, insightful, and deeply interested can join us for the summer school. The contribution towards online lectures is  Rs 2500  for the 18 - day event. No one will be denied participation due to lack of funds. Please write to us if you feel you deserve the merit cum means scholarship to waive your contribution.

Being BITSian

                                        (An online talk)

 

Widely considered the Father of Rural Marketing in India, he was once walking the same streets as you!

Now, he's back to reveal the wax and wanes of his journey.

 


 

These interactive talks, delivered by the alumni, would most definitely be a special connection to the heart of the attendees. Mr. Kashyap will talk about how a BITSian can make use of the various opportunities at the institute to catapult their profiles to be the best in what they aim to do. Though this place has evolved a lot, the core feelings and echo of the institute have remained the same over these years. Mr. Kashyap will talk about his personal experiences, coupled with an informal interaction that would surely benefit all of the BITSians in continuing the legacy. He will also touch upon his career in the rural marketing space and how he has reimagined the field completely.

 


 

Pradeep Kashyap is an entrepreneur and leader at heart. He is the Founder and CEO of MART Global Management Solutions. He founded MART in 1993, with a mission to enable the poor in emerging markets. He graduated from BITS Pilani in 1969 and has since worked in the corporate sector with big names like Bosch and Exide, as well as in the development sector. He has been the Marketing Advisor to the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India, and has served on Prime Minister Office and Chief Minister Committees on rural development. 

He also created Project Shakti with Hindustan Unilever to appoint 60,000 women micro-entrepreneurs as company dealers. 

BITS Embryo warmly welcomes you all!

Dear All,

Greetings from Practice School Division.

Practice School is a hallmark of the BITS Curriculum. Practice School is an educational innovation seeking to link industry experience with university instruction. Especially the capstone PS-II Program creates the required setting for experiential learning, by providing students with an opportunity to work on relevant assignments in an industry of their choice, under the guidance of professional experts and the supervision of faculty.

PS Division is happy to announce the release of the 9th edition PS-II Chronicles that is a compilation of student, mentor and faculty experience during PS- II in the second semester of the academic year 2019-20.

The students, industry mentors, and PS-II faculty have come-up with write-ups that offer an insight into the learning experience during PS-II.

The student write-ups are a window into the learning outcomes, the gap between academia and industry, and the day-to-day experiences of students as part of PS-II.

Mentor Write-ups reflect their working experience with BITS Students in all aspects of the student knowledge, academic preparation and work ethics.

PSD hopes that these chronicles will help every reader understand the type of work done by students in PS-II and will provide the necessary feedback path that will help bridge the industry-academia gap.

The chronicles are a must-read for Prospective PS-II Students as this will help understand the work that is happening at various PS Stations and what do the PS-II Mentors look for in terms of skill set.  It will help the student make an informed choice when filling the preference forms — the 9th edition of the PS-II chronicles, with this mail.

Thank you

We are glad and proud to announce that Pepper, the largest content marketplace in India, which bloomed out of our very own campus have raised their Series-A funding of USD 4.2. million (INR 31.6 Crores) from Lightspeed Venture Partners and marquee angels like Beerud Sheth (Founder, Upwork), Balaji Srinivasan (Coinbase CTO, ex-GP at a16z), Gaurav Munjal (Founder, Unacademy), Aakrit Vaish (Founder, Haptik), Miten Sampat (ex-CSO, Times Internet), Akhil Paul (Caparo Group), Utsav Somani (iSeed/AngelList), Dilipkumar Khandelwal (Ex-MD, SAP Labs India) and Gaurav Mandlecha (Product Evangelist, Airmeet).

Starting from a dorm room here at BITS to their entire team managing college with a venture of this scale, we are extremely proud of 21-year old Pepper co-founders Anirudh Singla and Rishabh Shekhar to have managed this feat so early in the age. This would be incomplete with a huge mention to their team - Kishan Panpalia, Himanshu Goyal, Aadesh Chandra, Aditya Sudhanshu, and Pranav Goyal without whom, this was just impossible.

They are probably the youngest folks in India to have raised an institutional amount of this sum. Kudos!

What started as a team of 5 people from BITS has grown to a 35+ members' team operating from Mumbai and we wish the entire Pepper team very good luck for the future!

Greetings from CEL!


Summer in a Startup (SiS), an annual internship program, is an initiative taken by CEL to help students learn and grow in the dynamic startup ecosystem through internships. We strive to provide internship opportunities to BITSians, to develop their careers with hands-on experience. 


As part of our project, we get you another internship opportunity at Cashfree. Here is a brief description.


***************

Cashfree is a payment and banking technology company, based out of Bangalore. As a complete payments platform, it helps 50,000+ businesses collect and send money with solutions such as an easy to integrate payment gateway that supports instant refunds; Payouts - an API banking platform for disbursals; a split payment solution for marketplaces; a Bank Account Verification API; a dedicated UPI stack for businesses and Auto Collect - a virtual account solution to match inbound payments to customers. It counts Xiaomi, Tencent, Zomato, Zoomcar, Cred, Club Factory, Shell, Google-backed Dunzo as well as donation platforms like Ketto and Milaap amongst its customers. Cashfree is working with all leading banks such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Yes Bank to build the core payments and banking infrastructure that powers Cashfree’s products. Cashfree is also integrated with major platforms like Shopify, Wix, Paypal, Amazon Pay, Ola Money, and Google Pay.

Cashfree was launched in 2015 as a payment gateway.

Cashfree is hiring interns from pre-final and final year batches for the following four roles. Please find the JDs of each role attached below.

Team Anant, the Student Satellite team, will be conducting a recruitment test for interested students from the 2019 and 2020 batches. The team comprises six technical subsystems that span the various engineering disciplines and one Publicity and Sponsorship team.


‌





We will be recruiting for all seven subsystems.

Designing technology to operate and survive in space requires high engineering precision and expertise from multiple disciplines. Artificial satellites have been orbiting the earth since the 1960s, and in each case, integration of all the different parts into a single functioning whole has been a monumental task. If you're even remotely interested in learning how to design a satellite, we would highly encourage you to give the test a shot. It's a fun but challenging paper that requires almost no prior knowledge except for what you've already learned in school. 


In case of any queries, contact the undersigned.

Now, he's back to reveal the wax and wanes of his journey from a BITSian to a Padma Shri Awardee.

Though this place has evolved a lot, the core feelings and echo of the institute have remained the same over these years. Dr. Kothari will talk about his personal experiences coupled with an informal interaction that would surely benefit all of the BITSians in continuing the legacy. He will also touch upon his career in Finance and his pivotal roles in commissions and firms around the world.

 


 

Dr. S.P. Kothari is the Gordon Y Billard Professor of Accounting and Finance at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, where he has served as Deputy Dean of the school as well.

Recently, he served as the Chief Economist and Director of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA) at the US Securities and Exchange Commission from March 2019 to January 2021. 

 

In 2008-09, he served as Global Head of equity research for Barclays Global Investors. From 2015-19, Dr. Kothari served as a Director of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). 

Dr. Kothari is a recipient of India’s Padma Shri award in 2020 and an Honorary Doctorate from London Business School in 2019.

The agenda of this meet would be to discuss viable ways of reopening campus for the batches 2018 and below as soon as possible as well as to increase direct communication between SU and the GBM. The meet would serve as a platform for GBM to raise any problems being faced by them and would also be open to pitches from new clubs, which would have to be intimated earlier.
We are very optimistic that major breakthroughs would be seen in these areas due to our sustained efforts and we would be successful in bringing back normalcy very soon.

The Alumni Relations Office is pleased to announce that Chaitanya Kalipatnapu (’97 | Pilani) has pledged a substantial contribution towards building an Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality Lab (AR/VR Lab). The Lab shall primarily be an exploratory space for the students and faculty of Pilani Campus, in addition to being a space for building innovative and creative solutions in the field of AR/VR.

The AR/VR Lab shall eventually be set up in the Incubation and Innovation Centre, coming up in Pilani Campus. A governing board shall guide the lab’s functioning, while Dr. Mukesh Rohil and his colleagues at the Computer Science Department will anchor the setting up and functioning of the lab.

When we asked Chaitanya about his opinion on what would make this lab successful, he said, “BITS has played a pivotal role in shaping my outlook and in my entrepreneurial journey. It is an honor and privilege to be able to give back to the Alma mater. I hope the state-of-the-art Lab will enable students to get hands-on experience with emerging technologies, and to positively impact our future through projects, patents and ventures.”

At an appropriate time, we shall circulate more details about the lab – equipment, working protocols etc. We could not be more excited to see this lab growing with a strong presence of students and faculty in the lab.

We hope that we will soon see you on campus, and hopefully, at the lab too.

We are thankful to Chaitanya for his contribution and support to BITS Pilani, and for providing this unique opportunity to BITSian innovators.

Greetings from the Department of Professional Studies,

CHRIST (Deemed to be University)

Being built on the principles of holistic education, innovative and progressive curriculum, Christ University has always focused on all-round learning.

The department of professional studies of Christ University is heralded as the renegade for change through differentiation in its programs by not only

encouraging holistic education and assimilating professionalism through its teaching pedagogy of inculcating few of the world's most acclaimed courses but

also through the plethora of exposure it provides to the student community through extracurricular activities. 

We are ecstatic to announce the thirteenth edition of Cognito, our national A-level intercollegiate Management fest! Cognito is the flagship event conducted by the

Department of Professional Studies and ever since its inception, the fest aims to bring its participants closer to the corporate interface reality. What sets Cognito aside

from other fests is that every round follows a storyline and the contingent faces tasks that represent the various managerial issues that a corporate does and would be

expected to resolve them by displaying keen commercial acumen. Cognito brings the corporate world right to you this time!        

Cognito has evolved exponentially in terms of scope and reach over the past 13 years, creating a platform for itself in the domain of Management festing.

This year, despite the pandemic we prepare to carry our legacy forward through the virtual

mode creating a global interface as we provide the students with a platform to flaunt their

Commercial and business skills. As we take participants into the world of the Corporates, we cordially invite you to our prestigious institution to participate in Cognito 2021.

We are excited to invite you to be a part of Cognito 2021-22, as contenders battle it out with the best of the best from across the globe. We look forward to your participation in

this event on the 8th, 9th and 10th of April, 2021. Contingent registrations close on March 25 (25/03/2021) and Quiz Registrations close on April 5 (05/04/2021).

Dear All,

Greetings from Practice School Division.

Practice School is a hallmark of the BITS Curriculum. Practice School is an educational innovation seeking to link industry experience with university instruction.

Especially the capstone PS-II Program creates the required setting for experiential learning, by providing students with an opportunity to work on relevant assignments in an industry of their choice,

under the guidance of professional experts and the supervision of faculty.

PS Division is happy to announce the release of the 10th edition PS-II Chronicles that is a compilation of student, mentor, and faculty experience during PS- II in the first semester of the academic year 2020-21.

The students, industry mentors, and PS-II faculty have come up with write-ups that offer an insight into the learning experience during PS-II.

The student write-ups are a window into the learning outcomes, the gap between academia and industry, and the day-to-day experiences of students as part of PS-II.

Mentor Write-ups reflect their working experience with BITS Students in all aspects of the student knowledge, academic preparation, and work ethics.

PSD hopes that these chronicles will help every reader understand the type of work done by students in PS-II and will provide the necessary feedback path that will help bridge the industry-academia gap.

The chronicles are a must-read for Prospective PS-II Students as this will help understand the work that is happening at various PS Stations and what do the PS-II Mentors look for in terms of skill set.

It will help the student make an informed choice when filling the preference.

 



 

Thank you

NSS BITS-Pilani is proud to announce
Our next online talk on

Safeguarding our Future Society Through Cybersecurity
By
Mr. Raj Samani

NSS BITS Pilani is extremely delighted to announce that we will be hosting Mr. Raj Samani for our next talk. Mr. Raj Samani is working as the Chief Scientist at McAfee and CTO at Intel Security. Samani has assisted multiple law enforcement agencies in cybercrime cases and is a special advisor to the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in The Hague. He has 59 publications to his name and has been identified as one of the top 50 most influential leaders in the cybersecurity industry.

We have often heard ""Data is the new oil"" but Mr. Samani has a different outlook on data. He believes that ""Data is the new currency"". This can be observed when Facebook bought WhatsApp for $16 billion even though the direct revenue from WhatsApp wasn't great. So, what was it exactly buying? That's right, you guessed it, it's data-our personal data, in the form of contacts, pictures, videos, and now, bank details because we can transfer money over WhatsApp.
This was back in 2014. In 2021, there is data leaking from our homes in ways we cannot imagine. From your PS4 to Alexa, everything is storing data-your voice, what you are saying, your location, everything. Keeping this in mind, NSS BITS Pilani has invited Samani to help us realize the importance of data security as well as understand that how every single piece of our data is monetized and that we have every right to protect it so that we do not end up becoming the product.


Please ask your doubts for the speakers on

Hope to see you there!!

Greetings fellow BITSians!

 

 

The Safety and Medical Advisory Council is proud to announce the launch of our website!

  As you may have guessed, we are responsible for the safety of all the students on campus. Be it encountering the occasional snake in your hostel or you, very unfortunately, breaking a bone(or several) during BOSM, we have your back. Our primary contribution comes in when we set up camp in the heart of two of our fests, BOSM and Oasis, where we provide first aid and medical resources to everybody on campus. We also ensure the overall safety and hygiene of our campus throughout the year.

 

The world around us is changing rapidly, some of us going through it gracefully, but if you're anything like me, there is probably a lot of kicking and screaming. With this, how each of us remains safe and healthy has changed as well. We now have to maintain our physical health from the confines of our homes and pay a lot more attention to our mental health. This website provides a few ways to survive, if not conquer, life in lockdown. It also introduces SMAC, the people, and the work behind-the-scenes . It includes information to contact us for all your health and safety needs on campus. But, we would be happy to hear from you until then, so feel free to reach out.

ch.png

While you are there, do not forget to check our blog section which we regularly update to keep the general BITSian community informed about the various aspects of health and well-being. Currently, our blogs regarding maintaining physical and mental fitness at home are up . In these, we describe how to keep your physique in check using minimal equipment and a sustainable diet, and how to stay sane during the insane times of online education.

Greetings of the day. Hope you and your loved one are doing well in these uncertain times.

 

EPF is offering two  online courses taught in the summer months, varying in length, structure and price. To get a taste of the EPF experience take a look at the video! If you would like to broaden your horizons at summer school and get a new learning experience then have a look at what is on offer below…

 





EPF (Ecole polytéchnique féminine ),France -  Graduate School of Engineering , was founded in 1925, as one of France's first Grandes Ecoles to train women to be engineers. It has been co-educational since 1994. EPF has now 3 campuses for its students. The first one is in Sceaux, close to Paris, where the history of the school started. The second one is in Troyes and the third one is in Montpellier south of France.

 

In 2020, EPF, France offered an online summer school in response to the pandemic, we proudly welcomed students from over 30 countries to study with us online in 2020. We look forward to bringing the transformative EPF experience to you again in 2021.

 

Our unique range of intensive courses are suitable for undergraduates, graduates, professionals and secondary studies students. Whether you want to earn credit, expand your existing knowledge or explore something new, the Academic Summer School will develop your critical thinking, enhance your career skills and challenge your preconceptions using new perspectives.

 

It is an opportunity to engage with world-renowned academics and get to know like-minded, inquisitive and socially engaged students from across the globe.

The Historical and Masonry Structures (HMS) group of the Institute for Sustainability and Innovation in Structural Engineering (ISISE), University of Minho, Portugal, plans to open a PhD student position (duration of the contract planned for 3 years) within the STAND4HERITAGE project, which is funded by a European Research Council Advanced Grant.

The position will focus on the definition of a set of new standards combined with an integrated analytical approach for the out-of-plane seismic assessment and subsequent intervention design of heritage masonry buildings. This is the main challenge of S4H, since it introduces rational rules for a task that has been approached mainly empirically.

The first step towards change is awareness.’ 


The WHO estimates that a country requires blood units equal to 1% of its population– a standard India has never met, even before the pandemic kicked off.



WBDD - Awareness (1).png

Through this campaign we seek to understand the need for blood donation, its acute shortage in India, busting myths related to blood donation but most importantly inculcating in the youth of this country healthy blood donation habits. 





Additionally, all participants filling the Feedback Form will be awarded E-certificates by BloodConnect. 

Do spread the word around and motivate as many people as possible to join the cause. This World Blood Donors Day, let us all pledge to donate blood as and when needed and eradicate any mishap due to blood shortage in the country.

With the current pandemic situation easing down and the number of active cases reducing on a regular basis, the corporates have been gearing up to scale up their workforces.

The national survey reports suggest an upward trend in the hiring process from the previous year as the offices reopen after long-lasting work from home setup and reduced man-power at most of the corporations.

We therefore need to prepare the students for the upcoming placement drives at your institute which will lay a foundation for them to easily be able to ace their tests for their dream companies. 
Being an organization that strives on the motto of ""Don't be Reactive, But Pro-Active"", we are proud to announce ""Big Bull Test Marathon"", a national level testing event wherein the students will not only be able to benchmark themselves nation-wide but also have a chance to win some exclusive Merchandise from us!

Hey Everyone! 📢

Free up your Saturday evening because we have something extraordinary planned for you ⭐️

We’re excited to announce that on July 24th, humit in partnership with bluelearn.in will be hosting a bunch of incredibly talented indie artists for a Music Nite via zoom. Two BITSian startups have decided to join hands in organizing a virtual musical showcase for the entire student community amidst the pandemic. For the uninitiated, humit is a social app reimagining the way people discover, share and express themselves with their taste in music. 


On that note, HUGE shoutout to our wonderful artists for their eagerness to be a part of this event!!

We’re thrilled to have singer-songwriter Tanmaya Bhatnagar headlining the show, whose rise to fame was expedited when her popular single “Kya Tum Naraaz Ho?” gained recognition from Oscar-winning musician A. R. Rahman. Give it a listen! 🤩

We are beyond grateful for Frizzell D’Souza as well, whose long-time kinship with music propelled her newfound journey of songwriting. Check out her recent debut single, “New” for a snippet of what you’re in for!

We’re also super hyped to have musician Rohan Shetty “SHOR” and Neyhal put on short & spectacular showcases for us on that evening, so don’t miss out! It’s going to be a field day for our BITSian community.

Btw if you were wondering, this can absolutely get better than it already is. Hop onto humit's discord server here  and stay connected with the amazing community.

So see you all on Saturday evening!

Greetings from the Student Alumni Relations Cell, Pilani Campus!

It is overwhelming to see that the whole BITSian community is geared up for the ceremonial occasion of the BITSians’ day. As is customary, BITSians' Day is celebrated on the first Friday of August every year. Since its inception in 2013, it has grown in prominence with each passing year and has become an occasion which BITSians eagerly look forward to – a chance to reunite with old mates, forge new bonds, relive old memories and make some new ones.

It gives us great pleasure to announce that joining us this year, we have Mr Garv Malik. His journey from being a student at BITS Pilani, working in some great companies, to finally deciding to start all over again as a standup comedian is truly an inspiration. Garv has performed in 750+ shows across 35+ cities and 4 countries. Before pursuing his dream profession, he has served in various capacities in companies like Shuttl and Larsen & Toubro. He graduated from BITS Pilani with a bachelor’s degree in Civil engineering in the year 2015.

Do join us on 7th August, 9M for “Saturday Night Lite with Garv Malik”, a chance to enjoy, giggle and laugh your heads off.
Register Here

The event has been organised with the spirit to give back to our society. We urge you to donate to the BITSAA COVID-19 Daily Wagers Support Initiative, a fundraiser run by the Pilani Campus and BITSAA for the workers affected by COVID. They have continued to make lives comfortable for everyone on campus, and now the onus is on us to help them through thick and thin.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been multiple incidents in the media wherein we observed that there was a huge influx of people who adopted pets during the lockdown. But the downside to that was the number of animals being abandoned on streets also increased manifolds.


This is a callout for any interested volunteers who want to help us in this journey of ours.

2. Letter of Recommendation and Appreciation endorsed by alumni from IIT Delhi and BITS Pilani for top 15 volunteers

Dear All,
Greetings from Practice School Division.
Practice School is a hallmark of the BITS Curriculum. Practice School is an educational innovation seeking to link industry experience with university instruction. Especially the capstone PS-II Program creates the required setting for experiential learning by providing students with an opportunity to work on relevant assignments in an industry of their choice, under the guidance of professional experts and the supervision of faculty.

PS Division is happy to announce the release of the 11th edition PS-II Chronicles that is a compilation of student, mentor, and faculty experience during PS- II in the second semester of the academic year 2020-21. The students, industry mentors, and PS-II faculty have come up with write-ups that offer an insight into the learning experience during PS-II. The student write-ups are a window into the learning outcomes, the gap between academia and industry, and the day-to-day experiences of students as part of PS-II. Mentor Write-ups reflect their working experience with BITS Students in all aspects of the student knowledge, academic preparation, and work ethics.

PSD hopes that these chronicles will help every reader understand the type of work done by students in PS-II and will provide the necessary feedback path that will help bridge the industry-academia gap.  The chronicles are a must-read for Prospective PS-II Students as this will help understand the work that is happening at various PS Stations and what do the PS-II Mentors look for in terms of skill set.  It will help the student make an informed choice when filling the preference.


Thank you

Events on Gather just got way better
Next time you host an event on Gather, you'll see some new things that we think you'll like. Enjoy!
Gather logo

Today we're excited to unveil an entirely revamped pre-event experience! We've dramatically simplified how easy it is to host any event on Gather, whether it's conferences, parties, workshops, networking sessions, or socials. We believe this is a huge step up in event quality and overall Gather experience, and we can't wait for you to see for yourself!
  	  	 

📝 Event Onboarding Flow

From your Gather homepage, you now have an Events tab to showcase all your upcoming events. From Events, select Create Event to jump into our new onboarding flow. 

 

Alternatively, from our Get Started page select Create Space and then Events to access our new onboarding.
  	  	 

✔️ Host Dashboard and Checklist

We're super excited to now offer event hosts a centralized dashboard that allows you to track progress toward creating and ultimately publishing your event. With a streamlined step-by-step checklist, event management in Gather is now easier than ever. (Keep in mind, an event ≠ reservation. If you'd like to turn your free event into a reservation for 25 or more guests, make sure you go to your dashboard in Step 4 to make a reservation!)
A screenshot of the Events checklist page. Three of the four steps are complete, which is indicated by a progress bar at the top. The Steps are 1, Basic Info; 2, Landing Page; 3, Space Creation; and 4, Space Dashboard. In Step 3, a preview of the Moon pond template in Gather displays.
Take me to Gather
  	  	 

🛬 Event Landing Pages

The event attendee experience is also about to improve dramatically! Events now come with custom landing pages, complete with event details and the ability to join, save, share, and add events to your personal calendar.

 

We also created a set of instructions geared toward new users that will always display on the landing page. Now everyone can come to the event familiar with the basics and equipped with the right tools!

The Event text to the right of the image lists the event title, the date and time of the event, buttons to Add to Calendar, Share, or Save, and a button to Join Event. Further down is a block of text under Event Details, followed by a section titled
  	  	 

📢 Information Board

You can now pin messages on an Information Board if you are a Moderator or Owner (with the exception of remote work Spaces; see more details in our Help Center). Keep your eye out for live announcements, which will let you broadcast real-time notifications to the entire Space. Coming soon!

Announcing our Series B and Why the Metaverse Matters
The Metaverse matters because it will create unprecedented access to opportunity for people, no matter where they are.
Gather logo

 

 

Today we are thrilled to announce that we’ve raised $50 million in Series B funding, led by Sequoia and Index Ventures! This is a huge milestone for us and we’re excited that our investors share our vision of the best way to build the Metaverse.

 

At Gather, we believe the Metaverse matters because it will create meaningful human connection and unprecedented access to opportunity for hundred of millions, if not billions of people, no matter where they are.

 

While the Metaverse is still very early, it isn’t a far-off sci-fi future—it’s already happening today, with Gather. Read more about Why the Metaverse Matters, from our CEO and

Co-Founder, Phillip Wang.

 

With backing from investors such as Sequoia, Index Ventures, Dylan Field (CEO of Figma), Jeff Weiner’s Next Play Ventures (Chairman and former CEO of LinkedIn), Y Combinator, and many others, we are just getting started!

 

Thanks for being a part of this journey.

Best of all, you can change your event details or the Space you're using without having to change your event link!

 

Just open your Gather homepage, select the Events tab, and select Create Event in the upper right corner. (Keep in mind that creating an event is not the same as creating a reservation! For events with 25+ attendees, make a reservation in

Greetings from Student Alumni Relations Cell!

We understand that Batch Snaps and the Yearbook are an integral part of every BITSian’s Life and capture the nostalgic memories of the graduating batch. The eventful years spent on the campus with seniors, batchmates and juniors turn into lifelong friendships. The Yearbook and Photos are what capture these memories for years to come.

Traditionally, the Batch Snaps are held in the second semester of your pre-final year. However, due to COVID, they were not organized for the past two years. With things being normalized and students back on campus, the Student Alumni Relations Cell is elated to announce that we are organizing the Batch Snaps for FD Batch of 2018 (Single Degree and Dual Degree Students), HD Batch of 2020 and MBA Batch of 2020, tentatively on 19th, 20th and 21st November 2021 (Friday, Saturday and Sunday).

This has been planned after extensive discussion and proper permissions from the administration and Director. According to your branch, they will be organized in slots, and every student participating in the Batch Snaps will have to strictly follow all mandated guidelines. A comprehensive document will be soon shared with detailed instructions, guidelines and schedule. This mail has been sent so that students can plan their leaves accordingly if they wish to participate in the Batch Snaps.

The snaps will be organized on the dates mentioned above unless communicated otherwise due to unavoidable circumstances. Please note that you would be only allowed to enter the venue in your designated slots, and this will be organized just for the students of the graduating batch who are on campus.

We are aware that some 2018 FD Single Degree Students are on PS-2. For such students, we would probably organize them next semester if the conditions allow. Please find attached a Document with some frequently asked questions.






Regards,
Student Alumni Relations Cell

Dear all,

Greetings. I am delighted to announce that BITS Pilani is among the 30 institutions selected to participate in the GATI (Gender Advancement for Transforming Institutions) project of DST, towards the journey of creating an ecosystem to build competencies and adopting best practices and pathways for transformational changes with focus on gender equity and women empowerment.

Project GATI pilots a sustainable self-assessment and accreditation model. The institute would be required to create SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound) action plans for systemic and cultural transformations. A metric-based self-assessment application followed by peer review would be employed to establish how well the principles of the GATI charter have been imbibed in the institutional framework through outcome focused initiatives.

We are looking forward to the partnership with Athena SWAN UK and GATI India to (i) identify gaps, systemic barriers and structural factors which need attention; (ii) adopt best practices & strategic plans; and (iii) implement policy level decisions to create an enabling, non-intimidating environment, organizational culture especially for women in STEMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine and Mathematics) disciplines in all stages of their career progression.

The institute leadership and GATI Self-Assessment Team (GSAT) with the support of you all will be working in a mission mode towards this initiative. Please visit  www.bits-pilani.ac.in/gati  for more details on the GATI initiative.

I am sure your wholehearted and enthusiastic participation in this journey of transformation would make it a beacon of gender equity in higher education institutes.   

 

Best wishes,

Souvik Bhattacharyya

Hi ASWIN,

Congratulations on making your first application on Internshala. We are happy to have you onboard with us!

Let's first get you acquainted to some of the basic and important guidelines to be followed on Internshala-

    Applying to internships and jobs on Internshala is always free. You DO NOT have to pay anything in order to secure an internship or a job through us.
    Please do not accept the internship or job (except NGOs or Campus Ambassador programs) if you are directly hired (without an interview or submitting an assignment) for it. The general process is that the employer takes an interview or gives an assignment. And, on the basis of your performance in that, you are selected or proceed to the next round of interview. If you do get hired directly then, please bring it to our notice by dropping a query from the Help Center.
    Always ask for an offer letter or an email that confirms your hiring and mentions the terms and conditions of internship or job from the employer before you start. In a campus ambassador program, generally, employers do not give an offer letter. In this case, if you receive an email with all the details of the program, then that works as well.

Great! You're all caught up now and have familiarised yourself with the general community guidelines. To read the guidelines in detail, click here.

Now, as your application has been shared with the employer, you must be wondering about the next steps. For that, you need to wait for a few days. If the employer likes your application, he/she will get in touch with you within 1-2 weeks and give you further details regarding the internship. You can also check your application status by logging into your Internshala account.

Tip - In case you do not get any response or a status update regarding your application from the employer within 1-2 weeks of applying and your application status remains 'Applied', 'Seen' or 'Under Review' then, it is best that you apply for various other internships and/or jobs that are available on the platform. You may also go through this article to know how you can improve your applications which will, in turn, increase your chances of getting hired.
All the very best!

Greetings from PMP BITS Pilani.

We hope this email finds you well. 

PS-1 is pivotal for BITSians since it gives them the first-hand experience of working in the real world. A lot of information about the stations, the CGPA cut-offs, etc. is circulated. This information is sometimes ambiguous, leaving the sophomore students confused, especially while filling their preference form.
In view of the above, PMP organized an interactive session, for 2019-batch students, which addressed some of the FAQs about PS-1. Seniors of the 2018 batch in different domains (IT, Core, Finance, etc.) talked about how they filled out the preference form, dealt with clashing interests of PS stations, post allotment evaluations, their overall experience, and any shortcomings they may have faced. 

If you missed out on attending the talk, or just need a refresher, we’ve got your back!!

As the process of filling out the preference form for PS-1 nears, we figured there may still be some unanswered questions regarding it all. PFA the recording of the event/Click on the link given below to access the recording of the event.

Hi ASWIN,

We regret to inform that you have not been selected for Management Trainee Internship at CareerBricks Learning Solutions. Some of the reasons why your application may not have been taken forward by the employer are-

    Poorly written application - There may have been grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, incomplete answers etc. in your application
    Incomplete resume - Important details like education, skills, projects, work samples, etc. may be missing from your profile
    Competition - The internship may have received a lot of applications and the competition just got harder!

Go through the internship preparation kit to improve your future applications.

This is regarding the previous mail titled  ""Placement & Internship Webinar | Profile Building Session | BYJU's Co Founder"" 

After sending the mail, we received some information and feedback from the previous year's students who had signed up for BYJU's CareerLabs after attending the webinar last year. 

A lot of students reported cases of fraud and cheating. The event has been called off from our end until they resolve the previous year's students' issue and take active steps to ensure they provide the best experience for all students from BITS Pilani.  

All the students are advised not to attend it.

""I will turn my dreams into goals. I will turn my goals into steps. I will turn my steps into actions. And through my actions I will achieve what I wish to""

Dear Student, 

Has it ever happened that you wanted to learn something and found yourself stuck at finding the right path? Have seniors told you too often to explore things but you've wondered how? Do you think to yourself how many IT companies are open for your branch in the internship season?

You're not alone. We've all been there. We believe till the time you are determined to give your best, unawareness, lack of resources and lack of guidance should never hinder you.

Hence we are building Project Expository.

Project Expository is an initiative under the Placement Unit that aims at creating guidance pathways for students. It aims at solving 4 major issues- 

1) Awareness on various careers opportunities via exciting podcasts with amazing BITSian seniors

2) Well curated learning pathways and resources for learners across disciplines like IT, Product, Finance etc.

3) Data backed insights from the PU to facilitate better decision making

4) Learning resources from leading colleges of India along with other exciting fields like competitions and challenges, CVs, off-campus opportunities

It is a campus wide initiative built on the experiences, learnings and data of the Placement Unit to help students gear up for all kinds of future opportunities.

The Beta Version for Expository shall be available on an invite only basis. Fill out the google form before 8th August, 2021 to confirm your invitation.

P.S. Project Expository is the team that built Summer Analytics Course - ABC. We are now set on our new journey to change the way BITSians perceive learning, awareness and information sharing. For clubs/organisations looking to become co-creators in our journey, please do reach out. Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.

Students are more likely to opt for regional engineering tests than JEE.

Dear Students,
It is nice to get in touch with you again for technology solutions to a societal cause. Responses from you were overwhelming and we have already submitted three projects for possible funding with students' participation. Now, there is another opportunity to demonstrate your skill to develop a technology solution for a social cause. I may invite new students who are not part of earlier project proposals if they are interested. I already have some ideas in this regard. We will discuss once the group is finalised. Please send me email if you are keen to be a part of the project along with your ideas related to this topic by 31 July 2021.
Wish you all the best

Dear Sir/Maám,

 

Greetings from Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF)!

 

The Indo-US Science and Technology Forum would like to invite you for the Solar Decathlon India 2021-22 challenge.  

 

Solar Decathlon India is a challenge for students to learn and design net-zero energy-water and climate resilient buildings. They partner with real estate developers and the industry and work on live building projects.

 

In the first year’s challenge, students from over 103 institutions across India participated in the challenge and gained foundational knowledge about building science and climate responsive design. Several students from the finalist teams were able to get placements and internships through our Career Connections session and kick-start their careers in sustainability towards combating climate change.  This year, these opportunities will increase and become stronger.

 

We hope you can share this information with your students who can join this initiative to create innovative solutions for net-zero buildings. Click here to register.

 

Feel free to pass on the message to others in your networks who can participate as Student Teams, Project Partners or Industry Partners in the 2021-22 Challenge.

Greetings from CEL, BITS Pilani! 


************************** 

Hoist is an asynchronous video management solution for creators and small businesses. We've just shipped the first version of the product,

which allows users to easily collect video testimonials from their customers and share them on their website and social channels.

Over the next few months, as we go to market and get feedback from our early users, we will need to rapidly iterate on the product and

prepare for scale. From a technical standpoint, this will involve -

    designing and building new features
    expanding the tech stack as needed (current stack - NextJS, Firebase)
    integrating with other applications our users use
    setting up building blocks for analytics and tracking

About this role
This is a paid internship position for 1-2 full-stack engineers for ~3 months. You will work closely with the founder on the above problem statements.
Based on your skill set and interests, we can figure out a sharper definition of projects and expected outcomes.

Location - remote
Hours - preferably full-time but open to part-time as well.

This role is a good fit for someone who can operate independently and hit the ground running.
We can promise high-quality engineering work and good overall exposure to other aspects of early growth,
including customer support, community building & content marketing. As the company scales,
we will be looking to make full-time hires in the next 6 months, and our first preference would be to hire from our internship pool.

Requirements

    1-2 years experience with modern tools like React, NextJS, Node, ES6, Typescript, Redux, GraphQL, CSS in JS, Webpack, Babel
    Experience architecting, developing, and testing client-side code end to end

Greetings from Project Expository!

With the recent surge of opportunities and hence the subsequent inclination of undergrad students for non-core opportunities like consulting and product management, there has been a significant drop in the number of students considering the core engineering domains as prospective career options. The attention that these fields get is plummeting and there is also a dearth of awareness about the core domains, the placement process, profile building and other aspects.

Project Expository plans to tackle these issues by organizing podcasts of students who have chosen to go the “core” way and have bagged some of the biggest job opportunities in their respective domains. The podcasts will include them talking about their resume building, projects, internships, interview process and preparation in general.

These podcasts will be uploaded on Expository and will be accessible for all. We request you to kindly fill out this google form to put in your queries regarding core placements, preparation, profile/CV building among others.

Dear Students, 

Greetings from the Placement Unit!

In the finance world, two common designations are the CFA Charter and FRM Certification. If you’re thinking about becoming a financial analyst or working with investments, these are the two designations that could advance your career. Making the right choice is important because each of the examinations takes a lot of hard work, money, and of course, a lot of time. Keeping that in mind, Finance Committee presents to you The CFA-FRM Talk. The talk is scheduled for 15th August (Sunday) at 12 PM.


    Raaj Dhanwani (Batch of 2017, M.Sc. Economics + B.E. Mechanical Engineering). He has cleared his CFA Level 1 and is currently an Equity Research Intern at Credit Suisse.
    Tarun Upadhyay (Batch of 2014, M.Sc. Economics + B.E. Mechanical Engineering). He has cleared his FRM Level 1 and is working full-time at Credit Suisse.

                      

    What is CFA/FRM? CFA vs FRM - How to choose?
    Why and when you should pursue CFA/FRM?
    How can you prepare for each of these exams?


See for yourself the coming together of CFA and FRM in one room, and decide for yourself. Is it CFA or FRM for you…. or both?  

Please join the session using this link. You can submit any queries for the speakers here.

For more information and queries, join our slack channel.

For any doubts, you may contact - 

Regards,
Placement Unit

Dear Students,

The Finance Committee aims at inculcating a strong Finance Culture in the students of BITS Pilani and ensuring the best finance placements, internships, informative sessions, interview preparation, workshops, simulation of portfolio allocation etc.

CFA and FRM are two of the most coveted certifications in the field of finance, and in order to understand both the examinations from a perspective tailor-made for BITSians, the Finance Committee had organized a session on the topic. The recording of the session can be accessed through this link and the slides used in the presentation can be accessed by clicking here.

During the talk, we also had a discussion around the introduction of an additional level in CFA (Level 4). Because it is a fairly new addition, we couldn't dive deep into the topic at that time. We have attached a video for your reference which will help you gain a better understanding.

Since a lot of students have questions about the finance courses offered by the institute, while choosing their electives for the term, we have compiled the course overview drive, a collection of short presentations that give a bird's eye view of the popular finance courses that are offered. The slides contain information about what's taught in the courses, what's their relevance, and how to ace them. We hope that this will help you in selecting the right courses for the upcoming semester.

The course material drive is a one-stop destination for all previous year papers and other resources that will supplement your academic efforts through the semester for finance courses.

To become part of the Finance Committee Slack group kindly use this link.  


Best Wishes
Finance Committee

Dear Faculty Colleagues and Students,


 
Wishing you all the best,

 

Cheers

Sudhirkumar Barai

Director, BITS Pilani - Pilani Campus


---------- Forwarded message ---------


Dear Sudhir, 

I hope you are well.


As you may already know, Harappa Education is a first-of-its-kind online learning institution which aims to help professionals build THRIVE skills—core social, cognitive, and behavioral skills—that are critical for career success through online courses and blended learning programs. 

Our conference Bridge has been envisioned with a goal to ignite and foster crucial conversations between academia and industry on our talent needs for the future. It will bring together on a single platform, India’s top academics, global education experts, industry talent leaders, and C-suite members, something that has never been done before!

We have an exciting line-up of speakers which includes Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman of the industrial conglomerate Aditya Birla Group; Laxman Narasimhan, Global Chief Executive Officer, Reckitt Benckiser Group; Chris Dede, Professor in Learning Technologies at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and a thought leader in the field of lifelong learning; and Julie Dirksen, author of the best-selling book Design for How People Learn. We have also selectively picked out topics like 'The New Age Resume'; 'Reimagining Faculty'; 'Do Internships Matter?'; and 'Preparing Gen-Z and Gen-Alpha' for discussions which will be held in 6 different formats!

This is the very first time that both educators and recruiters will come together to address the crucial issue of the employability gap and I really hope you can engage with at least a few sessions. You can check out the agenda and request your invitation here. 

I look forward to having you join us! 

Warmly, 
Pramath Raj Sinha
Founder and Chairman, Harappa Education

Dear Students 

Greetings from The FIRP (Forum of International Relations and Public Policy), BITS Pilani Goa campus. We would like to thank all of you for an overwhelming response to our Special Lecture on 'International Careers for Young Indians' with the speaker, Ms. Akshaya Shivkumar (World Bank, Washington DC). 



During the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been multiple incidents in the media wherein we observed that there was a huge influx of people who adopted pets during the lockdown. But the downside to that was the number of animals being abandoned on streets also increased manifolds.


This is a callout for any interested volunteers who want to help us in this journey of ours.

1. Co-endorsed Internship Completion Certificate from The FIRP and Zibatech Wellness Pvt. Ltd.
2. Letter of Recommendation and Appreciation endorsed by alumni from IIT Delhi and BITS Pilani for top 15 volunteers
3. A honorarium of rupees 1000 INR and goodies from Zibatech Wellness for the top-performing volunteers (depends on your performance)

Kind Regards,

************************** 

At utilize.app, we make no-code tools for businesses to scale without a technical team. Each business operates differently and requires customized business apps to run efficiently. Since custom apps are costly to build, they resort to complex ERPs, spreadsheets, or even pen-paper. Utilize solves this problem by creating a builder experience that makes software creation as easy as writing specifications. 

We are 2 co-founders (Ex BITS, Flipkart, Phonepe) and are looking for a product marketing intern to join us immediately on a remote basis. 

The internship is best suitable if you are looking to build a career in product or marketing or want to startup in your 20s. You can apply irrespective of your year. Bonus points if you have experience in writing content or doing marketing.

Responsibilities
1. Closely work with the founding team to iterate the product and establish a market fit
2. Reach out to new leads/potential customers through email & social media.
3. Create content for blogs and other required creatives to be shared in communities. 
4. Comprehend app requirements for onboarding new customers, deeply understand how the product works and help them build the apps.

Perks

    Letter of Recommendation

Hi there, dev-aspirant!

Getting your dream job feels great but the best part comes when you tell your parents about it and they feel that all their hard work was worth it. But it does not come easy, nothing in life comes easy. A package of 32 Lakh would definitely not be a cakewalk, but does that mean you do not even try? 

We know placement rejections hit hard but let us tell you a secret, if you are at it, one day you will get it. 96 girl coders recently got placed via Walmart CodeHers at packages up to 26 LPA, many of those were from Tier 2/3 colleges! You again stand a chance to get hired by 25+ Companies as they have opened their doors for you via D2C Recruitables, the biggest off-campus hiring drive for software engineers where companies are hiring at salaries up to 32 LPA and internship stipend up to 90,000/ month.

Apply Now for D2C Recruitables!

Now all that is needed is grit, perseverance to ace it from your end. To take you a step closer to this dream we have released the mock assessment that will give you a complete picture of the actual assessment pattern. Take the mock assessment and get ahead in the game!

Take the mock assessment 

You can ace it!

Dear Students, 

Greetings from Project Expository!

Project Expository is an initiative under the Placement Unit that aims at creating guidance pathways for students.

To tackle the lack of knowledge about the core fields of engineering, we have decided to embark upon creating more awareness by curating a series of recorded podcasts of students who have interned/got placed at prestigious firms in the core sector.

To begin with, we have recorded two podcasts with BITSians who have bagged exceptional offers in the fields of ET and Mechanical core.

In the ET sector, we have esteemed speakers like Rahul (Interned at Nvidia), Piyush Raj Jha (Placed at Expressif Systems) and Ananya Khandelwal (Interned and placed at Micron Technologies). 

In mechanical core, we have Kanishk Chaudhary (Interned at Boston Scientific) giving his insights on the placement process.

The links for the same are as attached below-
1. ET podcast
2. Mechanical podcast

We would request you all to go through the recordings to get more insights on the internship and placement processes apart from the general overview of the respective core domains.

Thank you!
Team Project Expository

Dear Product Aspirants,

Are you preparing for your first product interview? Are you finding it difficult to see the immense amount of PM prep materials available but not knowing where to start? We are here for you. We, PM Buddy, is a volunteer-led group of significantly experienced Senior Product Managers trying to accelerate your Product journeys. All the mentors have at least 5+ years of core Product Management experience and have hired multiple APMs/PMs in their careers.

PM Buddy is delighted to bring you two programs, a Bootcamp focussed on Cracking Product Management interviews and a Mock Interview and Mentorship platform where you can partner up with experienced Product managers to do 1-on-1 product mock interviews. Both the programs were created with the sole purpose of helping students crack their first product job. Please refer to the individual sections below to know more about each of these programs.

Program 1 -  Cracking Product Management interviews Bootcamp

We understand that preparing for PM interviews is unstructured and complex - especially when you are appearing for your first Product Management interview. So, how would you differentiate yourself from the several other candidates? This Bootcamp aims to prepare you for just that and provide you with a structured approach to cracking Product interviews. This is a condensed course that is very specific and focused on interviews and is great for anyone appearing for PM interviews in the next few weeks or months. This will help you in product management interviews in your target companies such as Flipkart, Ola, CRED, Axis Bank, etc. The course is structured and timed in such a way that you will be ready by the time on-campus APM roles and off-campus product intern roles open up.

What do we offer - 

    Learning from experienced Product Managers with ~ 8+ years of experience in product and expertise in hiring APMs and Junior PMs

    Product portfolio building and mentorship sessions 

    Lifetime access to a community of like-minded people and experienced PMs

How is this course different -

    The course is delivered by mentors who have been hiring APMs, junior and senior PMs for a few years now and they bring in several years of industry experience

    The course focuses on structured interview prep that will help you learn and apply in your interviews very well

More details about the course are attached in the brochure.

    Course dates - 2nd(Sat) and 3rd(Sun) Oct 2021

    Duration - 12 hours total

Greetings from the Wall Street Club!

Have you wanted to invest in stock markets, but have found it difficult to pick stocks based on a thorough analysis? Wouldn’t it be great if you could get a sneak peek at the investment portfolios that return the highest yields, and make your trades by simply shadowing the masters? We have collaborated with Trinkerr, to help you do precisely that.

Trinkerr is building India's first social trading platform. It is a platform that enables retail investors to view, learn, follow, and execute the strategies of their peers or more experienced traders. The application integrates community features with trader discovery and trade execution. Backed by investors from Accel Partners, Udaan, Unacademy, and Titan Capital, it aims to make financial markets truly inclusive and democratic for the next 100 million users.


Trinkerr Street 1.0, India’s first real-money stock-trading competition, is an initiative for aspiring Fund Managers, Financial Analysts, and Wealth Managers from premier B-Schools, Engineering, BBA, and B.Com colleges to showcase their expertise in the domain of Portfolio Management.

Participants are expected to follow the Best Equity Portfolios already available on Trinkerr during the course of the event. Candidates stand a chance to win attractive cash prizes and goodies up to 3 Lakhs, and a special chance to bag internships/PPIs at Trinkerr.



(Please enter BITS ID number in place of “College Registration Number”)

The competition begins on 11th October as a 2-week event, where participants can invest money in the best portfolios and attempt to earn the highest returns. 

The deadline for registration is on 17th October 2021. Hurry up!

Join the official Discord server to stay up-to-date with the event details.

Please go through the brochure attached at the end of this mail to read all the rules about the competition, its timeline, information about brokerage accounts, etc. 

To ensure that you are well prepared for the competition, Trinkerr has organized a seminar by Stock Market Scientist, on 10th October, where he will talk about Stock Market Psychology, with the aid of the Kübler-Ross model, and the Classical Conditioning Model by Pavlov. Seminar links and all other updates will be shared with registered participants and those on the Discord server. 

Warm regards, 

Soham Kulkarni

Wall Street Club, BITS Pilani.

P.S. Stay tuned for the next round of recruitments!

Greetings from BITS Pilani Consulting Club!


From a bunch of college-goers interested in the field of Consulting to a full-fledged group of over 20+ members focused on broadening their horizons and opportunities in the industry, the club sure has come a long way. A decade ago, the typical response to a mention of Consulting Club on the campus would be met by quizzical stares and awkward expressions, while people would try to figure out if they heard it wrong or whether it was some placement company that was in question. The club has managed to propagate consulting as a culture.


What does the club do?

Interactive activities like solving archived case studies, live cases, and guesstimates are focused on, to gain experience and expertise. Various current scenarios and new themes are discussed and debated during the sessions. There are also video conferences with Club Alumni, as well as ex BITSians, placed worldwide in major Consulting Firms, for the members to learn from. 


Who can join the club?
Contrary to the popular notion, a background in analytics, finance, or similar subjects is not necessary to join the club! All it requires is logic, common sense, and an urge to learn more. Over the years, club members have cracked top consults including Mckinsey, BCG, Bain & Co., etc., and have taken up challenging roles in related sectors like analytics, business development, and start-ups right after college.



BITS Pilani Consulting Club is now accepting applications from the 2021 and 2020 batches! There are no prior requisites to join the club, anyone from the 2021 and 2020 batch can apply to the club.

Use BITS mail to open the form.
Google form link for 2021 Batch

Google form link for 2020 Batch
Second-Year students are required to attach their resume in the form, a sample of which is present in the mail below.

We are looking for dedicated and hard-working individuals who are intrigued by the world of consulting. Join us to become a part of this club!


In case of any query, contact the undersigned.

Dear Sir/Madam

On behalf of the Gopalakrishnan-Deshpande Centre for Innovation & Entrepreneurship (GDC), IIT Madras, we are pleased to invite you, your faculty colleagues, researchers, and students, to the Information Webinar for Cohort 18 of our flagship I-NCUBATE program. The session will be held on Monday, 27th September 2021 (4.30pm to 6.00pm).

 

The webinar will provide an overview of the 8-week-long I-NCUBATE program, and how it can help faculty and researchers commercialize their research by the way of a start-up. Attending the webinar can help them decide if they should apply for the upcoming Cohort 18, which begins on 30th October 2021.

 

GDC was established at IIT Madras by Dr. Gururaj Deshpande, Mrs. Jaishree Deshpande, and Mr. ‘Kris’ Gopalakrishnan. GDC works with faculty, researchers, and students from STEM universities across India to implement a ‘Lab to Market’ mission by helping them commercialize their research and build startups that create socio-economic impact at scale.

 

I-NCUBATE Online, based on the LEAN Startup concept, caters to early stage and science-based startups. About 10 teams come together as a cohort to go through a “Customer Discovery” exercise with their respective innovations. The program helps faculty members, researchers, and students improve their entrepreneurial capabilities, and think of innovative ways to build their research ideas into viable and scalable startups. 

 

So far, over 145 startup teams, led by academic faculty members from 30 leading STEM Colleges in India, have participated in and benefitted from the 17 Cohorts of I-NCUBATE program. Listen to faculty (and entrepreneurs) from past Cohorts explain how they and their start-ups benefitted from the I-NCUBATE program.

 

Participants have found the I-NCUBATE program to be transformational. Nearly 60% of participating faculty in past Cohorts of I-NCUBATE were creating a startup for the first time. Over 65% of participating teams have gone onwards to incorporate their startups after attending I-NCUBATE and have raised over Rs. 450 million in external funding so far.

 


 

Best......Raghu

Greetings from the Student Alumni Relations Cell!

The Yearbook is a dedicated volume that captures the nostalgic memories of the graduating batch of an institute. The eventful years spent on the campus are engraved and expressed with photos and write-ups, a reminder of all the good times. Years down the line, when you look back, the yearbook will light up faded memories of walking down the NAB slope, late-night chai at ANC, birthday celebrations at -301 F, rushing for tutorials at the last minute and sleepless nights in the library before every exam. Visuals from these old, fleeting moments, photographs of your batchmates, stills from Oasis, inspiring words from your professors, and the aroma of all the food you made your wingies pay for will remind you of the institute that assisted you as you built yourself from the ground up.

 

The Student Alumni Relations Cell works throughout the year to publish the yearbook for the graduating class every year. This edition of the yearbook is exclusively meant for the First Degree batch of 2018 (single degree and dual degree) and the Higher Degree Batch of 2020.

We're excited to launch the Yearbook Portal 2022, a gateway to your college memories where you can post crazy pictures and interesting captions for yourselves and your friends. It is an effort from our side to help you relive your college life and capture those beautiful memories that you shared with your seniors, batchies and juniors.

Log into the Yearbook Portal

Please fill out the form if you wish to feature any of your captured photos of the campus in the Yearbook or have any concerns/queries.


    There is a no-limit rule to the captions you can write about your friends!

    The deadline to fill your Yearbook Quote and Photo will be 10th October, 2021

    A printed hard copy of the Yearbook will be made available (the opt-in form will be shared later).

    The hardcopy would contain your caption, a.k.a yearbook quote with your picture.

    You can modify your yearbook quote before the deadline through the edit profile option. The entered yearbook quotes should be limited to 140 characters or 25 words. 


    No emojis are to be used in the quotes.

    Please refrain from using photos with multiple people in them.

    Weird photos (such as those of anime characters, natural scenery, etc.) are not allowed.

    Uploading photos is a must for the yearbook.

Hello,
Greetings from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay's Techfest World MUN, 2021!  

In the past Twenty years, Techfest World MUN has become one of the best model United Nations conferences in Asia. Though the pandemic has imposed many restrictions, we, at Techfest believe that a lockdown should not stop students from enjoying the thrill and learning experience brought forth by debating and deliberating on world issues and matters of international concern and hence we present to you Techfest World MUN 2021.

Two days of stellar debate on agendas pertaining to the entire current geopolitical landscape, providing students with the opportunity to wake their inner leader and orator, Techfest World MUN is an experience that every participant would carry with themselves for a lifetime.

All students from Grade 8 to Degree College are welcome to join us in a 2-day conference of intense debate and engage themselves in international diplomacy and discussions.

We thus invite students from BITS Pilani to join us in a 2-day conference of intense debate and engage themselves in international diplomacy and discussions.
We therefore wish to invite your esteemed institution to send a delegation of your students to participate in this MUN (A delegation is a group of 12 or more delegates).


For the benefit of school students, we have decided to keep certain special committees that would be open only to students from grades 7th to 12th, hence ensuring that all participants are given the best opportunity to learn and display their skills.


SCHOOL COMMITTEES





COLLEGE COMMITTEES






Please note, priority registrations will close on 30th September, post which the registration fee shall increase.

Please note that all delegates who form part of your delegation need not register individually. The delegation manager/leader or the head delegate has to fill the aforementioned form that will be containing the details of all delegates of your delegation. 


We hope to host your esteemed institution's delegation at our conference. 

Warm Regards,
Akshata Jain
Director General,
Techfest World MUN 2021,

Dear All,


The trial access will expire on 10th October 2021



SAGE Research Methods supports research at all levels by providing material to guide users through every step of the research process. Nearly everyone at a university is involved in research, from students learning how to conduct research to faculty conducting research for publication to librarians delivering research skills training and doing research on the efficacy of library services. SAGE Research Methods has the answer for each of these user groups, from a quick dictionary definition, a case study example from a researcher in the field, a downloadable teaching dataset, a full-text title from the Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences series, or a video tutorial showing research in action.

SAGE Research Methods is the ultimate methods library with more than 1000 books, reference works, journal articles, and instructional videos by world-leading academics from across the social sciences, including the largest collection of qualitative methods books available online from any scholarly publisher. The site is designed to guide users to the content they need to learn a little or a lot about their method. The Methods Map can help those less familiar with research methods to find the best technique to use in their research. Built upon SAGE’s legacy of methods publishing, SAGE Research Methods is the essential online tool for researchers.

Hope you will find it useful for your research purpose.

Dear All,

We are excited to have you back on campus in good numbers after a gap of eighteen months (since March 2020). On-campus animal life comprising squirrels, hedgehogs and many bird species
(including our national bird peafowl, three types of doves and sunbird) roamed freely over this period. Our collective responsibility is to make sure that the animal life on campus continues to prosper
and flourish; as it did during the pandemic.

We have a significant peafowl population on campus. Their presence brings joy and peace to all campus residents. We ought to be extra careful after detecting the presence of the bird in our vicinity.
Our presence must not disturb the bird. 

If you encounter an injured bird, contact Prof. Sandhya Marathe (7733000698) or Prof. Sangeeta Sharma (9351388400).

Greetings!
While some of us are extremely delighted to be allowed to come back to the campus, a lot of us are also worried by the compulsory mode of evaluations, the decision regarding which has been taken by those in the administration. One major cause of worry is surely the ongoing pandemic situation which can wreak havoc in a student's life. We have got to know that parents of a lot of the students are worried due to the same as well and some even have been overburdened by the financial constraints owing to the pandemic which have been further increased by the urgent call for all those eligible to compulsorily come to the campus. In order to bring to light the problems being faced by the students, we have created a google form [attached below] which can be used to raise the issues regarding campus reopening. The responses of the same would be shared with the higher authorities and we will try to ensure that something can be done for the betterment of the students. We request everyone to please fill the form as soon as possible so that all the issues can be brought to the notice of the administration without any delay. 

For any queries, please contact the undersigned.

Hi ASWIN BENEDICT,

Tata group for the first time has opened the doors of Tata Administrative Services (TAS), an IAS equivalent of the private sector via Tata Imagination Challenge to all the students across domains.

TAS, Tata group's flagship leadership development program, was conceived by the legendary JRD Tata in 1956 as an elite service of young managers when he observed that there were people with impressive business acumen, but were limited by education or experience. Today the Tata Group has 30 companies in over 100+ countries and TAS Managers are leading it at every front and now they have opened their doors again to hire TAS Managers of batch 2022.



Apply now if you think you can be that leader who can take the Tata group to greater heights, who can add to their strength, as the Tata group is looking for more than those who just fit role titles and descriptions but want to #SettleForMore because the Tata group is more than a company and TAS is more than just a job.

All the best!

Regards,
Team Dare2Compete

Dear BITSian,

 

Each year, BITSAA receives thousands of applications for Merit cum Need scholarships to fund their tuition fees and various initiatives for the enrichment of the student experience in BITS.

 

A single pledge for monthly sustained giving from you can make an immense difference in a student’s life, and assist various crucial programs BITSAA runs for the student community.

 

No amount is too small. If a batch of 500 pledge to donate Rs. 500 a month, they can potentially support Merit-cum-Needs scholarships for 15 students a year!* A small pledge from us alumni can create a huge impact for the students. Please join us in making this recurring donor drive a success.We don’t need to wait for jubilee celebrations to give back to our community. BIT BY BIT we build BITS!


-> Please make sure you choose the “Monthly” option while donating


 

 


-> NEFT payment mode available now. Card payment / Netbanking method will be added soon


 

Funds generated through this campaign will be disbursed to specific students or groups based on need or merit. The funds will support Merit-cum-Needs scholarships, enable student activities including travel for competitions, scholarships for off campus research and international thesis as well as provide financial support for student projects. We will continue to work with the institute to identify areas of maximum impact.

 

Please contact us at <fundraising-team@bitsaa.org> for Naming Rights or an Institutionalized Fund if you are considering giving a large donation. Corporate gift-matching is a very powerful tool for charitable causes and we support and encourage it. Every donation in India is eligible for 100% deduction on income tax under section 80G. 

*Merit cum Need scholarships cover 40-50% of college tuition fees.

With Love,

BITSAA International

Dear All,

In a historic event, a BITS Pilani student has launched his second rap song across all music platforms making him BITS Pilani's First-Ever Professional Rapper.

The artist behind this rap song - Dhiraj Singh Pawar is currently studying at the Pilani campus.

This song titled 'KHUDGARZ' is a fierce reminder for all the artists out there to continue creating art even if the odds aren't in their favor.

The song is an amalgamation of the London Underground Drill and Grime scene tweaked for the Indian Hip-hop culture. 
An apt song for playing on loud woofers- you'll surely end up vibing with this one.



instagram.com/rapbydhiraj


We hope that the song fills you up with energy and motivates you to keep going- even when the time is dark.


Best regards,
Dhiraj Singh Pawar (2019A3PS0286P)

Dear Student,

Please find the revised list of allotments. We understand that many of you are not getting a room as per your expectations. Remember one thing, once you are on campus and meeting your friends, I am sure that you will forget all the grievances you are having. In this phase, we have called the students based on the availability of locked rooms. The data is very dynamic due to many reasons.


Here are general answers to the queries you have posted.


1. Want a single room but have been allotted a double room?

We are aware of the fact that some of the rooms have been left unoccupied. This is due to inadequate data because of the fast and dynamic process in the current scenario.
The empty/locked rooms will be allocated once things settle down. Please be patient until then. All the unoccupied rooms can be allotted on request from 17th October onwards.
If you and some of your friends agree to mutual shifting, we will sort out the issue after your arrival.

2. Allotted rooms are occupied by PS or off-campus TS students?

You may stay with your friend or get a room with the help of the respective hostel superintendent for the time being. After 17th October, if required depending on the vacancy, we will try to re-allocate you.

We expect your cooperation in the process and hope that you understand the situation right now. Please be rest assured that we are with you in the whole room allotment process and trying to do our best.

With best regards,

Navin Singh

Greetings from NSS, BITS Pilani!

The relationship between seniors and juniors at BITS is a special one. College seniors are supposed to be the first mentors for the young adults far from home. But sometimes, in the name of introduction or initiation, millions of students are brutally abused in many educational institutions. 


About the Speakers

Ajay Govind is an award-winning filmmaker, educator and anti-ragging activist. Being a graduate of St. Stephen's College (Delhi University), he has interacted with over 15,000 participants. Ajay's anti-ragging documentary film 'Thereby Hangs a Tale' has won accolades all across India and has been associated with S.A.V.E.,(no2ragging.org) since last about a decade when one of his close friends lost his life due to ragging.

Gaurav Singhal is Vice-President and the R.T.I. Cell Head of S.A.V.E. Perturbed with the murder of a medical student in the name of ragging in 2009, he joined the Anti-Ragging N.G.O. S.A.V.E. Gaurav Singhal has also appeared at various media like T.V., FM and Newspapers over the last few years to spread awareness about the ragging issues. He was also invited to Aamir Khan's show Satyamev Jayate to highlight the ragging problem in India.

Shivam Yadav, a pharma graduate, contacted SAVE as a victim in 2013 during his college days and later started volunteering for SAVE. He provides counselling for ragging victims and works in the Victim Supports Team of SAVE and is instrumental in filing R.T.I.s to colleges and government authorities and monitoring the cases in National AntiRagging Helpline.

By 

Venu Madhav Miriyala

Senior Vice President, FIS India 

Economics and Computer Science - BITS Pilani, 1993 Batch

Core Banking Platforms are back-end systems that process banking transactions across the various branches of a bank. The system essentially includes deposit, loan, and credit processing. Among the integral core banking services are floating new accounts, servicing loans, calculating interests, processing deposits and withdrawals, and customer relationship management activities.

Core banking systems are aimed at empowering existing and probable customers to have greater freedom of their account transactions. With technological evolutions, transactions are now safer, faster, and less cumbersome. The fact that these transactions can be executed remotely, from any part of the world has made core banking systems a significant aspect of banking these days.

Venu Madhav Miriyala is a BITS Pilani alumnus from the batch of 1993   

He is currently the Senior Vice President at Fidelity Information Services. FIS is one of the world’s Largest Core Banking providers supporting the Core Processing Needs of 100’s of Banks across the world. Mr. Miriyala is leading the company's Global Next Generation Corebanking Engineering Centre.

He has spent more than 25 years in the Core Banking Domain working in many countries and was involved in engineering multiple Core banking Platforms from the ground up. His studies included courses in software engineering, functional programming, systems design, introduction to management science, and project management.

Join us on the 13th of October at 5 pm.

Dear Students, 

Tata Group for the first time has opened the doors of Tata Administrative Services (TAS), an IAS equivalent of the private sector via Tata Imagination Challenge to all the students across domains.

TAS, Tata Group's flagship leadership development program, was conceived by the legendary JRD Tata in 1956 as an elite service of young managers when he observed that there were people with impressive business acumen, but were limited by education or experience. Today the Tata Group has 30 companies in over 100+ countries and TAS Managers are leading it at every front and now they have opened their doors again to hire TAS Managers of batch 2022.



Apply now if you think you can be that leader who can take the Tata group to greater heights because the Tata group is more than a company and TAS is more than just a job.

Best,
Team TIC

Dear BITSian,

 

The teams at Alumni Relations, BITS Pilani and BITSAA International write to you with a grateful heart that is deeply indebted to you for your generosity and the incredible support you have shown to the Daily Wagers Campaign! 

 

It is with pride that we want to let you know the funds collected from the campaign have already been put to use - as promised - to support the daily wagers community on campuses with ration packages.

 

We are also happy to let you know that campuses are beginning to reopen, and already have the senior batches return to campus-life in September, slowly. The remaining batches will also return to their campuses over the next few weeks.

While that is good news for the daily wagers with their regular businesses slowly coming alive, BITSAA will continue to support them with the funds received, as previously decided, at least until December 2021, and will reassess the situation as things evolve with the pandemic. 

 

Any excess funds from this campaign will be redirected towards student scholarships. We’ll keep you posted on the updates from the campaign.

 

We also want to take a moment here and bring to your attention our ongoing fundraising campaigns, should you be feeling generous this festive season ✨

 


 

Please feel free to reach out to the fundraising team should you have any questions regarding the campaign at all, they’d be happy to help! 

 

Much thanks once again, your kindness has changed lives!

 

With warm regards,

Dear All,
Greetings from Practice School Division.

Practice School-I (PS-I) is an integral part of the curriculum of BITS Pilani, offered to First Degree students at the end of their second year of the degree programme, during the summer. PS-I is an exposure-oriented course of an eight-week duration, the goal of which is to provide students an opportunity to observe how the workplace functions and help them apply the knowledge gained during their studies in the workplace. PS-I helps students nurture their professional, cognitive, and technical skills and host organizations by the enthusiastic participation and contribution of students to their ongoing work at their working premises.  PS-I is monitored and evaluated by a resident faculty, who conducts the program, in consultation with the host organization coordinator.  PS-I faculty is ably supported by student co-instructors and faculty co-instructors in operational and technical aspects, respectively.

Keeping the largest interest of wider knowledge dissemination, PSD is happy to bring forth the second edition of the PS-I Chronicles featuring over 1800 articles from PS-I students sharing their experiences during summer 2021. The basic premise behind the release of PS-I Chronicles is to document the PS-I learning experience of students keeping the below objectives in view.

1. To provide more information on the learning experiences by immediate senior students and PS-I faculty about stations, thereby enlightening the student community's learning opportunity.
2. To provide the faculty with enhanced information about the type and nature of work carried out at the organization.
3. To transform the knowledge gained at the organization into classroom teaching and identify the scope of deepening the collaborations with the organization.

The articles have been classified into five categories based on the industry domain.

PSD hopes that these PS-I chronicles will help every reader acknowledge the type of work done by students in PS-I and provide the necessary feedback path to bridge the industry-academia gap.

The chronicles are a must-read for prospective PS-I Students as this will help understand the work that is happening at various PS I Stations.  It will also help the student to identify his/her interest and hence enhance the scope of making an informed choice while filling the preference forms for PS-I.


Thank you
Prof. Gaikwad Anil Bhanudas
Associate Dean, PSD, Pilani campus

Greetings on behalf of SOVESA!



We were enthused to see active participation from the students in the 1st part of the Discourse and we are feeling extreme delight to again invite all the brilliant minds to take advantage of the jewel of the wisdom of Bhagavad Gita.    

 

Bhagavad Gita is said to contain Rāja-vidyā i.e. the highest of all knowledge and Rāja-guhyaṁ, i.e. the most confidential knowledge….

rāja-vidyā rāja-guhyaṁ

pavitram idam uttamam

pratyakṣāvagamaṁ dharmyaṁ

su-sukhaṁ kartum avyayam

This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed. (BG 9.2)

Thus, understanding the seriousness of the message of the Gita, we wish to lend a helping hand to all the genuine seekers of the Absolute Truth, to the ones who are in search of answers to the basic questions of life, and also to the ones, who want to experience a new dimension of life.


Fundamental understanding of important verses in Bhagavad Gita for direct application in daily life.












No prerequisites. Expressed curiosity and open-mindedness is all that you need to understand Bhagavad Gita. Students from all years.



    Certificate of Appreciation (for students who have scored more than 75% in the exam)

    Big Discount on Inception Camp to be organised in the month of January (for the students who have attended >= 7 sessions and scored more than 75% in the exam)



To pacify the thirst of the intelligence that seeks an answer to the mystery of the Creation and Sustenance of the Universe, we have planned to organise a Spiritual Camp, INCEPTION, which aims at answering these unanswered questions not just in a dry, theoretical or philosophical way, but by practical experience.




1. A Trip to the Holy Land of Vrindavan

2. Exploring The Pink City, Jaipur 

3. Thrilling and Refreshing experience of Morning Program

4. Delicious Mouth watering Prasadam(Sattvik, Spiritual Food)

5. Discourse on Cosmology and the Creation of the Universe

6. Bonfire and Skit play

7. Special 1 to 1 interaction with Senior, Experienced Youth mentors

8. Gaushala Visit 

9. Extensive Discussions on Bhagavad Gita

and many more....


We hope to see an active participation from your end. And if you have any queries, doubts or suggestions, please feel free to get in touch.

Yours faithfully,

Maunil Chopra

Effects of Marijuana | DyneFit
The Effects of Marijuana on Your Body

Marijuana is made from the shredded and dried parts of the cannabis plant, including the flowers, seeds, leaves, and stems. It’s also known as pot, weed, hash, and dozens of other names.

Learner Outcome
“I stated on my CV that I had experience in regression modelling and cluster analysis, could code in R and SAS, and had trained younger staff - almost all of this was as a direct result of the Coursera courses I’d taken. A week later an agency called and said they’d love to take me on with a flexible schedule and for more than double my previous salary.”

Dear ASWIN BENEDICT,


1. Describe how climate change adversely impacts human health across various populations.

2. Plan for and enact adaptation actions that build resilience to climate change’s negative health impacts.

3. Communicate effectively about the health effects of climate change to the public and policymakers and influence changes in climate-related health behavior.

The program gives you access to live weekly discussions with your peers and expert faculty, our global alumni network, and is eligible for CME and CPH credits. The next offering begins September 8th and the deadline to apply is quickly approaching. Apply by August 31 and learn more today!


“The program provides a wonderful introduction to the topic and tools for making an effective contribution through helping people understand climate change and take action to protect their own health and that of the planet. The instructors and teaching assistants are experts in the field.” – Terri Ballard, DrPH, Epidemiologist, Montebuono, Rieti, Italy

“Not only do you learn what you can do to help climate change mitigation or adaptation, you learn how to communicate this to others effectively in order to get more people engaged with the issue.” – Johnnie Yates, M.D., Family Physician, Honolulu

“The course has made me a stronger, more convincing advocate for addressing climate change. I feel I have improved capacity to communicate about the issues more effectively. The live sessions also helped me learn more about what other communities are currently dealing with, as other students shared what they are experiencing where they live.” – Maureen Gates, Los Angeles County Dept of Health Services

Thank you,

Research Internship at NUS - An Intern's Experience
  	
   
Research Internship


Dear Customer,

 

Greetings from Corporate Gurukul Singapore!

This week we are delighted to share with you the various aspects of ‘research internship’ in particular at NUS.

Siddharth, a student from SRM University, India who went through the internship, covers aspects of both machine learning and deep learning and highlights the business aspects of real-world problem solving. The blog outlines the methods and ways in which a person can use different deep learning models and techniques such as ‘transfer learning’ to aid in their projects.

This is explained with a brief introduction and explanation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that was used to create a project revolving around the detection of facial expressions and their analysis which further sheds light on the current mental state of the person. Though not a very accurate measure, it has numerous practical uses ranging from classrooms for preschool children to packed stores for the analysis of how people react to the release of a new product.

Let us know your feedback!😊

Secret behind MS Admissions Abroad
  	
   
Research Projects


Dear Customer,

 

Greetings from Corporate Gurukul Singapore!

This week we share with you yet another experience on how a research project helped our Intern to secure his masters admission in a world-class university abroad.

Aditya is currently pursuing his Masters in Computing at National University of Singapore (NUS). The article talks about the importance of research and how it can do wonders for you, especially if you plan on applying to the best universities out there. Further, basics on how to go about research internships and what the admission's office of international universities look at in a student’s profile has also been discussed. This gives you an edge over your peers and helps you secure that university seat which you have been longing for all this while.

According to the World Health Organization, about 295,000 women died during and following pregnancy and childbirth in 2017. We know that the majority of these deaths are preventable.  While progress has been made, significant disparities still exist and the rate of death and disability remains unacceptably high in many countries and communities.

Yale’s newest online course, Global Quality Maternal and Newborn Care, is designed to provide the tools, background, and recommendations you need to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality in your own setting. In particular, you will learn about the evidence behind implementing the midwifery model of care as a means to advancing the health and wellbeing of mothers and babies globally.

Anyone who wants to see maternal and newborn outcomes improved globally or in their own community—health administrators, policy makers, clinicians, advocates—is invited to take this course to address these issues.

The pandemic and its aftereffects are likely to last even after COVID is restrained, leading to a “new normal”, that is,  people will be compelled to remain socially distant due to the fear psychosis. However using technologies like Augmented Reality, will bridge the gap between the people and the businesses.""

Data Visualization is the art of representing data in the form of charts and graphics. Visual representations of data allow you to better understand data’s underlying pattern.
  	
   
Manaswini


Dear Customer,

 

Greetings from Corporate Gurukul Singapore!

In the age of Big Data, Visualization plays a very vital role in understanding and making sense of the large datasets. The visuals tell us a story by highlighting the trends and outliers, separating the noise from useful data, and presenting the results of our analysis in a simple but powerful way. In Data Science, data visualization is a key part of Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Mining, and presenting the results of a model. 

Although underplayed, this tool is a must in every data scientist and ML engineer’s ever-growing toolkit.

Must-know topics to start a career in Cyber Security
Student Life in Singapore
  	
   
Abhishek


Dear Customer,

 

Greetings from Corporate Gurukul Singapore!

How to kickstart a career in cybersecurity? What are the basic skills required to bag a job in a cybersecurity company?


This was the question that came to my mind when I aspired to get into a Cybersecurity company with an internship experience of 6 months. 

Being a fresher to cybersecurity, I went through a lot of blogs, videos, and courses to understand cybersecurity which helped me to crack the interview at a leading cybersecurity firm about which I have discussed in this blog.

Ancient Craft Meets Modern Technique
Learn how one master luthier made her love of guitar-making into her own, creative process
Click here to view this email in your web browser.
Autodesk
ANCIENT CRAFT MEETS MODERN TECHNIQUE
Hi Aswin,
Making comes from the heart. That’s what we learned from master luthier, Rachel Rosenkrantz, who used to walk by the French lutherie Atelier de Maurice Dupont every day on her way to school observing the ancient craft of guitar making. See how she uses computer aided design to make her dreams into reality.
Read more
Design, Craft, & Music
As a design student, Rachel Rosenkrantz paid close attention to disciplines where she could combine all three of her passions – design, craft, and music.
Modern Design & Manufacturing
Rachel sketches her designs and then uses 3D modeling to double-check her work before 3D printing it. The additive manufacturing process offers her ample opportunities to play around with designs that would otherwise be impossible to make.
Creativity in Design
According to this master luthier, design doesn’t have rules. It has principles. Deciding how to put those principles to use with computer aided design is the fun part.

Dear Customer,

Technology has changed the traditional warehouse management system by altering the way companies send and receive orders. Traditional systems can be problematic because as a company’s volume order increases, the system of receiving and distributing orders becomes more complex. 

In this Blog, Cyril emphasises on the need of the hour for warehouse management systems to adapt to new inventory and the changing business landscape by effective automation.

“Coursera is a game-changer just for leveling the playing field. It allows you to get a high-quality degree at a rate that you can afford. Getting my degree from the University of Illinois is something I’m very proud of. I’ve landed in a position that is exactly where I want to be. Earning my MBA gives me confidence. I wanted my kids to know that you don’t ever stop.”

Launching IdeaHunt
Written by Mayank Singh ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌
		
	
Launching IdeaHunt
Written by Mayank Singh
Jul 7		Comment	Share


And that's precisely how this came to fruition. Ideas arguably constitute an organisation’s most valuable assets. Businesses and individuals are constantly searching for fresh, new ideas – the source of innovation. While some people believe that new ideas preserve brilliant minds, others argue that people's ability to find good innovative ideas is more about habits than intellect. 

If breakaway ideas come more accessible to those in the habit of looking for them, how can this habit be cultivated? And where do you find people with such ability? Yup, rightly guessed, Colleges! A place where you truly understand the essence of the free mind, a site that is a community of dreamers and doers. 

Having been in those exact shoes, the entire team knew the next step for college grads who come up with ideas in the middle of the night, ""how do we validate the idea?"" Idea validation is always painful for makers. We wanted to create a tool that eases this whole process.

There comes IdeaHunt. It takes crowdsourcing to a new level. People can vote for your idea, leave a comment to the creator, and start a conversation about the future product.
		

Jack Welch once said, ""Someone, somewhere, has a better idea."" We believe great ideas come to those who are in the habit of looking for great ideas all around them, all the time. Too often, people fall into the trap of thinking that the only worthwhile idea is a thoroughly original one. 

We understand that valuable ideas are already out there, waiting to be found - and not just in the usual places. Whether you are looking for your next product, a solution to a growth hurdle, need a new logo or creative ways to meet your goals, we are ready and waiting for you. 

What if you don't want to put an idea? Well, vote for the best ideas and give direct feedback to the creator. Help them create your next favourite thing.

Want to submit an idea? → IdeaHunt

Lastly, ping us anywhere! LinkedIn | Twitter | Facebook | Instagram

We are now Hallparty!  🎉

Hi,

We have a news for you. We are no longer Assist.

We loved being Assist, to be known as helpful, prompt and always there but some time back we felt that it missed the most important thing about college - all the fun.

We wanted our users to feel the vibes of a college party, hanging out with their friends, feeling the serendipity of hopping on in a room full of people. We wanted them to feel the evenings of ANC, and chai of VK Redi. Eating the pizza sandwich of Sky, drinking MNB at Blue Moon, early mornings at Nutan.

We wanted to bring back the memories of study sessions at the Library right before the Compres and the Prof Shows of Oasis. The liveliness of Bedrock and countless stories told by seniors. Gandhi 317. Ahem.

So we decided to change, and become just more of us, we decided to call ourselves Hallparty. Change is hard and often uncomfortable. Change needs friends. Hope you all would love Hallparty just as much as you loved Assist.

And we will continue to help you connect with your friends, interests, and communities all throughout the campus. 
Join Hallparty 🎉

Dear BITSian, 

 

This year, yet again the strength of the entire global BITSian community has shone through. Be it virtual or in-person, meet-ups across generations and continents proved that we are in fact the strongest alumni network in the world! 

 

4000+ attendees 

120+ locations

40 companies

21 batch events

15 universities

 

As stated by our Chancellor, this intangible bond that ties all BITSians together is a truly magical bond that makes a BITSian go above and beyond to help other BITSians in need. We saw this at the numerous virtual networking sessions during BITSians’ Day and in the selfless contributions of Alumni towards the BITSAA COVID-19  Support initiatives.  

 

BITSians' Day App covering the city meet-ups, batch meet-ups and other featured events made this year even more special. The browser-based app offered a platform to access the venues and stay updated with the events and announcements seamlessly.

 

Thanks to tireless efforts from our BITSAA Volunteers, Chapter Leaders, and Batch Representatives, we were able to put together a host of programs and leave a global footprint yet again.

 

In the 72-hour long fest, we had

    Address by Mr. Kumar Mangalam Birla

    Fireside chat series - Red Hot Pixel Pepper, Tackling Mental Health - BITSian Startups 
    Featured Events - BITSian Startup Pitches, Talent Showcases
    Batch and university meet-ups in addition to city and company meet-ups
    A pan-Africa meet
    A pan-Latin America meet
    BITSians attending multiple events across the globe

 

BITSAA extends a heartfelt gratitude to our sponsors - Shobhitam and Beco - for making yet another BITSians’ Day a huge success!

 

In addition, we conducted two rewarded contests and are happy to announce the winners.

Trivia Contest

 

In this 3-day long contest, we hosted a fun BITS Trivia on the Quizizz platform. We thank Beco for sponsoring the prizes for this contest!

Photo Contest

 

In this 2-week long contest, we called out BITSians to upload a throwback treasure which depicted their BITSian journey in a click!

BITSAA congratulates all the winners and they will soon receive the prizes!

Upcoming Events

 

🏳️🌈On the 3rd Anniversary of Section 377 being abolished in India, the decriminalisation of LGBTQ relationships, meet Anuradha Gupta live at


Regards,
BITSAA International

Design on Canva
	 
 

Tip 1
  	
Make it personal

Looking to add your own touch to a design? Easily upload images, videos, gifs, or audio, and customize them like any other element in Canva. It could be a logo for your business or a video of family and friends. Already have something uploaded online? Connect and grab content directly from your Google Drive, Dropbox, or social media accounts.
	 
  	Upload something 	 
 
 
 

Tip 2

Get creative with video
  	Adding video footage is a great way to create powerful, eye-catching, and memorable designs. Browse through our massive library of royalty-free clips, use them as a backdrop with text on top, or even stitch some together with our new video editor. The creative possibilities are endless. 	 
  	Browse videos 	 
 
 
 

Tip 3
  	
The power of music

A great piece of music really sets the mood for your work. It’s also a great way to add a personal element, using a style that reflects what you love. Whether you’re into Pop, Rock, Electronica, Classical, or a genre that you’ve just discovered, you’ll find inspiration in our audio section under the Elements tab.

Cocreate Discontinuation
On October 1st, Gather will discontinue support for Cocreate whiteboards.
Gather Desktop Header

Hey there,

 

On October 1st, Gather will discontinue support for Cocreate whiteboards. Cocreate whiteboards may be found in older Gather Spaces (created before April 2021).

 

If you have data stored on a Cocreate whiteboard that you don't want to lose, please save your whiteboard's contents as an .svg file using Cocreate's built-in tool.
Screen Shot 2021-09-02 at 11.31.29 AM

After our support ends, interacting with a Cocreate whiteboard will result in an error message. You can erase these whiteboard objects from your Space like any other object. Placing new whiteboards in your spaces will create whiteboards powered by Eraser.

 

To keep up with the latest news, updates, and other new features, check out our public changelog!

Your JEE Result Doesn't Matter.

In this episode of the CNTC (Cup Noodles To Career) Show,  we talked to Ishan Sharma (2019 Admitted, BITS GOA Campus) on how he founded MarkitUp alongside his college and how he managed regular content creation - gaining over 100,000 followers in the last 3-months alone!

 

This episode talks a lot about Content Creation, Entrepreneurship, and MarkitUp's journey. After IIT-JEE Results came out in 2019, his IIT Dream was shattered and from that disappointment to founding his own company in college and hitting 200k+ Subscribers on Youtube in just one year - he is a true inspiration to countless students. A lot to learn from his story. I am sure you’ll be inspired from this one!

Dear BITSian,

 

To recognize and honor outstanding achievements of BITSians under the age of 30, we run the BITS 30 Under 30 awards every three years.

 

These awards are dedicated to all those young BITSians who thought and acted differently, challenged the status quo, rewrote the rules, and created their own paths, and are the best examples of what it means to be a BITSian.

 

The awards are open to all BITSian students & graduates from Pilani, Goa, Hyderabad, Dubai, and the Distance Learning programs. We will consider all achievements that took place before the nominee turned 30. All those who are born after January 1989 are eligible to apply.


We welcome you to nominate worthy candidates, and also self nominate yourself if you fit into any criteria.

 

An outstanding panel of BITSians who collectively represent excellence in Industry, Academia, Non-Profit and Arts, has been created to decide the winners. These names will be shared in due course.

 

The categories are here.

The nomination form is here.

Nominations are open till October 15, 2021.

 

We look forward to receiving your nominations.
Thank you

Notion
There's something special about the sound a German car door makes when you close it.
 ‌ ‌ ‌ 
Notion

Hi there,

There's something special about the sound a German car door makes when you close it. A good, solid thud — a feeling of quality and craftsmanship. So when our engineers are prototyping new Notion features, we often ask each other ""Does this meet our quality bar? Does it feel like a German car door?""


(1) Set a home page for your public site

Hosting your blog, resumé or portfolio on a public Notion page? If you have a paid plan, now you can set a public home page in Settings & members → Settings. Share a short and customized URL (acmedesign.notion.site, for example) that takes folks straight to your home page.

A cursor selects the URL bar in a Safari browser window and types acmedesignnotionsite then the browser shows the public Notion page at that address

Learn more about public pages →

(2) New emojis and other mini-features


    Dozens of new emojis & page icons
    Include dynamic @today & @me mentions in database templates & template buttons
    Copy & paste multi-column layouts

A slideshow of Notion pages with titles cover images and a selection of new emojis as page icons including bubble tea tamale transgender flag otter potted plant and more

See more updates →

(3) New comments sidebar

Collaborate with your friends, family members & classmates through a completely redesigned comments experience in Notion. Now you can see every comment on a page at a glance, and respond to any comment thread — all consolidated in your new right-hand sidebar.

A cursor clicks the new comment icon at the top right of the Notion desktop app which opens the new comments sidebar

Learn more about comments →

(4) Back to school

Any students or educators in your life that want to get organized? Is that person you? We have some exciting updates to share!

    We now offer discounted team plans for university groups and clubs! And the Personal Pro Plan is still 100% free for students and educators. Learn more →
    We gathered the best Notion templates for students and educators to organize everything in one place, so you can focus on getting the most out of school. Grab the templates →
    For students or anyone learning a new skill (especially coding students!), our friends at Codecademy put together this resources organizer to help you manage your online courses, books, and frequently referenced docs.

Notions desktop app is shown with a template from Codecademy - a database to organize resources for school

I hope these improvements make your Notion workspace feel more useful, and more solid. Wishing you a productive rest of your week.

Warmly,

Ivan

Co-founder & CEO

P.S. We are hiring across engineering, sales, marketing & more — please tell a friend 🙏
Notion

Notion.so, the all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.

Messages from Notion, including our Customer Experience team, will always come from a @makenotion.com or @mail.notion.so email address. We will never ask you for account information like your password or answers to security questions.

Dear BITSian,

 

To recognize and honor outstanding achievements of BITSians under the age of 30, we run the BITS 30 Under 30 awards every three years.

The awards are open to all BITSian students & graduates from Pilani, Goa, Hyderabad, Dubai, and the Distance Learning programs. We will consider all achievements that took place before the nominee turned 30. All those who are born after January 1989 are eligible to apply.


We welcome you to nominate worthy candidates, and also self nominate yourself if you fit into any criteria.

 

An outstanding panel of BITSians who collectively represent excellence in Industry, Academia, Non-Profit and Arts, has been created to decide the winners. These names will be shared in due course.

 

The categories are here.

The nomination form is here.

Make your big ideas happen with Canva
 
 
  	
	  	
Design on Canva
	 
 

Jess’ lightbulb moment
  	After interning at a wish-granting organization, North Carolina local Jess Ekstrom saw kids were having a tough time after losing their hair during chemotherapy. She wondered whether something as simple as a headband could lift their spirits, and her business Headbands of Hope was born. For every headband sold, one is donated to a child with an illness - over one million have been donated to date. 	 
  		 
  	Today, Jess operates her business from the road, living and working in an Airstream with her husband and dog as they travel around the county. With Canva, Jess has the flexibility to create and collaborate remotely with her team, designing social media posts, videos, presentations, and thank you cards for sick children everywhere. Jess says Canva has been a “game-changer” for her business.
	 
  		 

“We hope each headband will serve as a reminder, when our customers wear them, that small acts of kindness can make a huge impact.”
  		 
  	So if you’ve got an idea, sometimes all you need is a spark of inspiration to bring it to life. Explore our massive library of templates and see if it lights a fire within you?
	 
  	Find your spark 	 
 
 

Advice from Jess
  	
1
	Start now.
“You’re never going to be ready, so you might as well just start when you’re inspired.”
	 
  	
2
	Stay focused.
“Take one step at a time. Thinking of the big things you want to do long term can distract you from what needs to be done now.”
	 
  	
3
	Back yourself.
“Don’t be afraid to fail. One of the biggest lessons I’ve learnt is that nobody knows what they’re doing (at first).”
	 
  	Feeling inspired? All that’s left to do is make it happen. You can start by writing your business plan, creating a logo, or your first social media post - you’ll find everything you need to hit the ground running with Canva.
	 
  	Take the first step 	 
  		 
 
 
  	
We want to hear your Canva stories

What has Canva helped you achieve? Start a new business? Nail a school project? Create something special for a loved one? We love hearing stories from our Canva community, so please don’t be shy.

Notion
Everybody has a to-do list. And there's no better feeling than crossing something off that list.
 ‌ ‌ ‌ 

Hi there,



Try it out

    See your tasks grouped by priority in a minimalist List view, so you can stay focused on the most important items
    Group your tasks by urgency & sub-group your tasks by importance in Board view to decide which tasks to do first, and which to schedule for later
    Visualize your to-do list grouped by a Relation property connected to a goals tracker to make sure you're prioritizing the tasks that matter most


There's no better feeling than crossing something off your list. I hope that these new grouping features help you experience that feeling more often than you thought was possible.

Warmly,

Ivan

Co-founder & CEO

P.S. We are looking for lots of software engineers, recruiters, sales folks & more. Know anyone?
Notion

Notion.so, the all-in-one workspace for
your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.

For Sam Baker, love is what matters most. At 99-years-old, he wrote the children's book Oscar the Mouse and fulfilled a long-time dream. Now, the WWII veteran is using Canva to design a gift only he can - a photo book for his grandkids. It's filled with memories, wisdom, and the life lessons.

Events on Gather just got way better
Next time you host an event on Gather, you'll see some new things that we think you'll like. Enjoy!
Gather logo

Today we're excited to unveil an entirely revamped pre-event experience! We've dramatically simplified how easy it is to host any event on Gather, whether it's conferences, parties, workshops, networking sessions, or socials. We believe this is a huge step up in event quality and overall Gather experience, and we can't wait for you to see for yourself!
  	  	 

📝 Event Onboarding Flow

From your Gather homepage, you now have an Events tab to showcase all your upcoming events. From Events, select Create Event to jump into our new onboarding flow. 

 

Alternatively, from our Get Started page select Create Space and then Events to access our new onboarding.
  	  	 

✔️ Host Dashboard and Checklist

We're super excited to now offer event hosts a centralized dashboard that allows you to track progress toward creating and ultimately publishing your event. With a streamlined step-by-step checklist, event management in Gather is now easier than ever. (Keep in mind, an event ≠ reservation. If you'd like to turn your free event into a reservation for 25 or more guests, make sure you go to your dashboard in Step 4 to make a reservation!)
A screenshot of the Events checklist page. Three of the four steps are complete, which is indicated by a progress bar at the top. The Steps are 1, Basic Info; 2, Landing Page; 3, Space Creation; and 4, Space Dashboard. In Step 3, a preview of the Moon pond template in Gather displays.
Take me to Gather
  	  	 

🛬 Event Landing Pages

The event attendee experience is also about to improve dramatically! Events now come with custom landing pages, complete with event details and the ability to join, save, share, and add events to your personal calendar.

 

We also created a set of instructions geared toward new users that will always display on the landing page. Now everyone can come to the event familiar with the basics and equipped with the right tools! 
A screenshot of the Events landing page. An image preview shows the silhoutte of a man walking down a street full of neon signs. The Event text to the right of the image lists the event title, the date and time of the event, buttons to Add to Calendar, Share, or Save, and a button to Join Event. Further down is a block of text under Event Details, followed by a section titled
  	  	 

📢 Information Board

You can now pin messages on an Information Board if you are a Moderator or Owner (with the exception of remote work Spaces; see more details in our Help Center). Keep your eye out for live announcements, which will let you broadcast real-time notifications to the entire Space. Coming soon!
A screenshot of the large game room template in Gather. In the Left Nav Menu, the pushpin icon is outlined in red, and the Information Board is showing the Pinned Messages section. There is no current pinned message.

Dear ASWIN BENEDICT,

Welcome to Introduction to CAD, CAM, and Practical CNC Machining.

In this course, we’ll explore the basics of Autodesk® Fusion 360™ CAD by learning how to properly sketch and model 3D parts. Before we program any toolpaths, we’ll explore CNC machining basics to ensure we have the foundational knowledge needed to effectively define toolpaths.

Finally, we’ll explore the basics of setting up a CAM program and defining toolpaths to cut simple geometry.


    Be ready. We’ll provide a lot of hands-on learning in the software. Sign up for an Autodesk account and download Fusion 360 now. Students and educators can download a free 3-year education license, while professionals and commercial users can access a free 30-day trial or subscribe to Fusion 360.

    Learn and earn. Complete all courses in the CAD/CAM for Manufacturing specialization to earn a digital badge and PDF certificate from Autodesk. Continue learning, then show off your new skills on your resume and on social media like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.

And enjoy!

We also encourage you to join the Autodesk Student community online to connect with thousands of like-minded peers from across the world.

All the best,

Autodesk
