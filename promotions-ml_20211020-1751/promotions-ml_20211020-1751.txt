Trump's Syria withdrawal plan shocks allies
US president says Islamic State has been defeated, but defence officials want to maintain a US military presence in the region
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Donald Trump‚Äôs abrupt decision to withdraw US troops from Syria will be welcomed by Russia and Iran, both of whom have been working hard to supplant American influence in the region.

The biggest losers from the move meanwhile are likely to be US allies, such as the Kurds and Israel ‚Äì not to mention the US itself, which could end up being drawn back into the region if, as some expect, the withdrawal helps Islamic State forces regroup.

shock decision
Is the US withdrawal from Syria premature?
To the surprise of his allies and the frustration of senior officials Donald Trump has decided to pull out all US troops from Syria, claiming Islamic State had been ‚Äúdefeated‚Äù and their job is done.

There are currently around 2,000 US troops on the ground in the war-torn country where they are primarily training local forces to combat Islamic State (IS). They have helped rid much of north-eastern Syria of the terrorist group, but pockets of fighters remain.

Nevertheless, ‚Äúa complete, rapid withdrawal, if confirmed, would upend assumptions about a longer-term US military presence in Syria‚Äù reports Al Jazeera. READ MORE ‚ñ∏

US economy
Fed raises rates despite pressure from Trump
The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates again, following a two-day meeting to discuss the state of the US economy.

The move, which adds 0.25% to official interest rates aiming to reach a target between 2.25% and 2.5%, came despite unprecedented public lobbying by Donald Trump, who had pre-emptively called a rate rise ‚Äúfoolish‚Äù and ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù.

Strategies for Debriefing Healthcare Scenarios

May 17, 2019 | 10:00-11:00 am PDT | Online via Zoom

Presented by Center for Advanced Pediatric and Perinatal Education (CAPE), a part of Stanford Medicine

Healthcare professionals work in complex, high-risk environments where safety is paramount. Yet, they often don‚Äôt have the necessary time and tools to analyze their performance during training in order to develop strategies to overcome weaknesses and reinforce strengths. Debriefing is one of the most effective methods for empowering healthcare professionals of all experience levels to improve their individual and team performance. By fostering a nonjudgmental and productive environment you can help your team hone their ability to provide consistent, high-quality, safe patient care.

In this webinar, CAPE‚Äôs directors, Lou Halamek, M.D. and Nicole Yamada, M.D., will use an interactive discussion and video exemplars from CAPE‚Äôs new online debriefing program to highlight and analyze four foundational strategies from CAPE‚Äôs 20 Strategies for Effective Debriefing.

You‚Äôll learn:

    How to clearly communicate expectations for how a debriefing will be conducted

    How to begin debriefings in an objective and efficient manner

    Ways to avoid creating defensiveness during debriefings

The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

‚ÄúI would do a deal with the devil to get a proper Brexit,‚Äù Nigel Farage said recently on his LBC radio show. But the MEP may not have to call on Lucifer to get his wish.

With the Conservatives reportedly plotting an electoral tie-up, this afternoon‚Äôs top story looks at how a Tory-Brexit Party pact might work.

What a Tory-Farage pact would mean
Nigel Farage is in ‚Äúsecret talks‚Äù with Tory party donors about a pact for a snap general election, it has been reported.

The Daily Telegraph claims the Conservatives might offer not to stand candidates against Farage‚Äôs Brexit Party in dozens of seats, in a bid to ensure the UK leaves the European Union by the end of October.

‚ÄúUnder the idea, the Brexit Party could agree not to stand against Tory Brexiteer candidates, while the Tories would not fight Metropolitan Labour seats in the north of England where the Brexit Party is strong,‚Äù reports the Telegraph.

britain's next PM
Who won the First Tory leadership TV debate?
Five of the six MPs hoping to become the next Tory leader and prime minister clashed last night in the first televised leadership debate of the contest. So who won last night‚Äôs debate?

The Times‚Äô Quentin Letts says: ‚ÄúThere was accomplished debate-society swivelling from Gove. We had a few zingers from a neatly combed Stewart, a headmasterly air from Hunt in a Union Jack badge, and a tolerant decency from Javid, who (perhaps to his credit) seemed least comfortable with the event‚Äôs self-promotional demands. Dominic Raab smouldered wonderfully.‚Äù

How a child murderer ended up working at an Oxford primary school
A woman jailed for killing a schoolgirl as a teenager was able to teach at primary school in Oxford for almost a year without disclosing her conviction, it has emerged.

Iria Suarez-Gonzalez, now 35, became ‚Äúone of Spain‚Äôs most notorious killers‚Äù after she and a friend stabbed 16-year-old Clara Garcia to death in 2000, the Oxford Mail reports. According to media reports from the time, the pair - who cut Garcia‚Äôs throat and stabbed her 32 times - were driven by a desire to know ‚Äúwhat it would feel like to kill someone‚Äù.

DOWN TO BUSINESS
Monday afternoon markets
London‚Äôs leading share index inched higher today in line with marginal gains across Europe, ‚Äúas rises in banks outweighed the impact of a profit alert from Germany's Lufthansa on airlines, while UK contractor Kier Group skidded to a life low‚Äù, reports Reuters.

Shares in easyJet and British Airways owner IAG took a hit after the German airline giant issued a shock profit warning, admitting that its short-haul business had been dented by fierce competition and amid concerns over surging fuel costs.

Shares in the US benefited from slight gains as markets opened this morning, while the big mover was Sotheby‚Äôs, whose shares were up 58%, after French businessman, Patrick Drahi, agreed to buy the auction house for $3.7bn.

FTSE 100: 7,364.17, up 0.25%

Quote of the day
‚ÄúThere is a growing feeling in the party that when we get to the final two we should have a robust debate between two credible change candidates. We need change‚Ä¶ People don‚Äôt want to see a final that‚Äôs some kind of Oxford Union debate.‚Äù
Tory leadership hopeful Sajid Javid says the final run-off should not be between two old Etonians and Oxford graduates.

What does prorogation mean for your money?
	  	
  	There are many questions being asked by investors today as a result of yesterday's decision to prorogue parliament.

    Will this trigger a vote of no confidence?
    Will the pound fall again?
    Will people "sell" and do their research later?

MoneyWeek's executive editor, John Stepek says ‚ÄúI'd expect turbulence over the next couple of months, certainly. But if you're an active investor and stock picker, I'd use that time to build up your cash reserves and make a watchlist of stocks that you want to buy. This is the kind of torrid atmosphere that creates buying opportunities for quality companies at usually low valuations."

Dear Watchers,

Thank you to all who wrote in to share their social-distancing viewing rituals and projects. It sounds as if a lot of folks are finally summiting Mt. ‚ÄúSopranos,‚Äù and I wish all of them a blessed voyage.

I hope those of you who can stay home are staying home, and I hope those of you who are working in essential services are getting the support you need.

I Want Something Engrossing
O.J. Simpson as seen in ‚ÄúO.J.: Made in America.‚ÄùESPN Films

‚ÄòO.J.: Made in America‚Äô

When to watch: Starting Tuesday at 7 p.m., on ESPN.

This five-part documentary is among the best nonfiction series ever made. It blew me away when it premiered in 2016, and I have thought about it hundreds of times since, both its literal accomplishments in format and its broader ideas and themes. It‚Äôs about O.J. Simpson, but it‚Äôs also about everything ‚Äî race and sports, of course, but also California history, models of justice and the light-bending heft of fame and power.
Continue reading the main story

ESPN is re-airing all 10 hours of the series this week: Parts 1 and 2 air on Tuesday at 7 and 9 p.m., 3 and 4 on Wednesday at 7 and 9 p.m. and Part 5 on Thursday at 9 p.m. Even if you are not typically a true-crime or sports-doc person, consider giving this a try, even just to marvel at the range of archival footage.
I Want Something Emotional
Laura Dern, left, and Luke Wilson in ‚ÄúEnlightened.‚ÄùNicola Goode/HBO

‚ÄòEnlightened‚Äô

When to watch: Streaming now, on HBO or Amazon.

Social distancing can make one a little numbed, so reconnect to the human endeavor with this beautiful two-season HBO dramedy about the tricky parts and some of the good parts of being alive. Laura Dern stars as Amy Jellicoe, who thinks maybe she can change the world, starting with her corrupt company, or maybe herself, or her mom, or her ex-husband. The show‚Äôs prickliness can take some getting used to, so I encourage you to give the show four episodes to get its vibe. It has some of the emotional ideas of a fairy tale ‚Äî the sense of longing, the bold individualism, the urgency ‚Äî but the grounding and brininess of a social satire. If you‚Äôve been reading more poems lately and feel you need to take your heart for a walk, watch this.

I Am Going Stir Crazy
Now we can all study the blade.Annette Brown/History

‚ÄòForged in Fire: Knife or Death‚Äô

When to watch: Now, on Hulu.

Sometimes all that‚Äôs left is watching people stab buckets of sand with homemade swords. God bless. This obstacle-course series is like a hot tub for your brain ‚Äî I wouldn‚Äôt do it 24/7, but there are times you just need to be blissed out and boiled stupid. Competitors bring their own blades of choice and put them to the test with a series of strange challenges, like slicing through a raw chicken hanging from a string, or cutting through a watermelon dropped from the ceiling. There‚Äôs no blood and guts, and the show emphasizes safety and sportsmanship, so it‚Äôs also fine for most ages. I have seen every episode.

Movies: Newly Available This Week

With theater chains shuttering multiplexes to prevent the spread of coronavirus, major studios have scrambled to make new theatrical releases available for home viewing. Since our last Monday newsletter, several major studio films were released online early, and this week‚Äôs newly available titles include a few more early arrivals ‚Äî along with the year‚Äôs biggest flop and the story of a violin prodigy who vanished during World War II.

Unless noted, the films can be purchased on the usual platforms ‚Äî Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. A rental option is usually available within a few weeks, though some are available for short-term rental now. (Click here for more details.)

Here‚Äôs what our critics had to say about the new selections:

‚ÄòEmma‚Äô (available now)
Everything has been emphatically embellished, so much so that it initially seems that [the director Autumn de Wilde] has adapted the material using Wes Anderson software. ‚Äî Manohla Dargis (Read the full review here.)

‚ÄòThe Hunt‚Äô (now)
An almost-successful attempt to do for class and ideology what Jordan Peele‚Äôs ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äù did for racism. ‚Äî A.O. Scott (Read the full review here.)

‚ÄòThe Invisible Man‚Äô (now ‚Äî A Critic‚Äôs Pick)
This shrewd, cleverly updated version plays with the different meanings of ‚Äúromance‚Äù by fusing the basic conceit from [H.G. Wells‚Äôs] uncanny tale with the fallout of an abusive romantic relationship. ‚Äî Manohla Dargis (Read the full review here.)

‚ÄòOnward‚Äô (now; on Disney Plus April 3)
The mild, one-joke amusement of ‚ÄòOnward,‚Äô directed by Dan Scanlon (‚ÄúMonsters University‚Äù), comes from the clash of the mundane and the fantastical. ‚Äî Ben Kenigsberg (Read the full review here.)

‚ÄòBirds of Prey‚Äô (coming Tuesday)
Unlike ‚ÄúJoker,‚Äù this exercise in R-rated fan-flattery allows itself, and the audience, to have some fun with its noisy, hectic, self-conscious riffing on the conventions of comic-book-based entertainment. ‚Äî A.O. Scott (Read the full review here.)

‚ÄòBloodshot‚Äô (Tuesday)
‚ÄúBloodshot‚Äù runs out of meta tricks before it is over, and David S.F. Wilson, who borrows his visual vocabulary from Tony Scott and Michael Bay, delivers action sequences with such choppy continuity that viewers may be as confused as [its hero]. ‚Äî Ben Kenigsberg (Read the full review here.)

‚ÄòDolittle‚Äô (Tuesday)
[The director Stephen Gaghan] apparently ran into issues while making ‚ÄúDolittle,‚Äù leading the studio to bring in other filmmakers. Even so, the story remains thin, the performances wobbly, the laughs infrequent. ‚Äî Manohla Dargis (Read the full review here.)

‚ÄòThe Gentleman‚Äô (Tuesday)
The point is cleverness and looking cool ‚Ä¶ mostly the movie is about [Guy Ritchie‚Äôs] own conspicuous pleasure directing famous actors having a lark, trading insults, making mischief. ‚Äî Manohla Dargis (Read the full review here.)

‚ÄòJust Mercy‚Äô (Tuesday)
Just Mercy is saved from being an earnest, inert courtroom drama when it spends time on death row, where it is opened up and given depth by two strong, subtle performances, from Jamie Foxx and Rob Morgan. ‚Äî A.O. Scott (Read the full review here.)

‚ÄòThe Song of Names‚Äô (Tuesday)
The movie never quite justifies the contrivance of its puzzle-box construction. Parlaying this material into an arty whodunit cheapens the real history invoked. ‚Äî Ben Kenigsberg (Read the full review here.)

Essie Davis in ‚ÄúMiss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears.‚ÄùAcorn TV

    The movie sequel to the Australian series ‚ÄúMiss Fisher‚Äôs Murder Mysteries,‚Äù ‚ÄúMiss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears,‚Äù is now streaming on Acorn. It has a sort of diet ‚ÄúIndiana Jones‚Äù vibe and can be a little on the hokey side, but the show‚Äôs charm and glam are back in full force, too. Become a hat person! Embrace your truth!
    ‚ÄúOne Day at a Time‚Äù returns Tuesday at 9:30 p.m. on Pop TV, having survived its Netflix cancellation. It seems like its same happy self, and as usual, benefits from watching several episodes in a row to acclimate to its multicamera pacing. Only one episode airs per week now, though, so a DVR stockpile is in order. (Read more about this season here.)
    Spring finales are upon us. ‚ÄúThis Is Us‚Äù finishes Tuesday at 9 p.m. on NBC, ‚ÄúStumptown‚Äù Wednesday at 10 p.m. on ABC, ‚ÄúAwkwafina Is Nora From Queens‚Äù Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. on Comedy Central, ‚ÄúStar Trek: Picard‚Äù Thursday on CBS All Access and ‚ÄúThe Sinner‚Äù Thursday at 10 p.m. on USA. ‚ÄúUs,‚Äù ‚ÄúAwkwafina‚Äù and ‚ÄúPicard‚Äù have already been renewed, but ‚ÄúStumptown‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Sinner‚Äù have not.

Wait, one more thing ‚Ä¶

If you are considering adding a streaming service to your current lineup, note that a lot of them are offering promotional extended free trials right now. Slate has a roundup of most of them, and Amazon, Hulu and Netflix also have free 30-day trials (as usual). If you‚Äôre looking for classic, foreign and art-house films, Criterion Channel is offering a 14-day trial and Mubi is now charging $1 for three months‚Äô access.

Statistical errors are surprisingly common in medical literature. Fortunately, you don‚Äôt need a degree in statistics to catch these errors. In many cases nothing more than common sense and simple arithmetic is required. In addition, there is an ever-increasing number of free, easy-to-use online statistical tools that facilitate error detection. In this session, Stanford Associate Professor Kristin Sainani demonstrates how to apply these statistical sleuthing tools using real-world examples.

Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (XCS224N)

Natural language processing (NLP) is undergoing rapid evolution as new methods and toolsets converge with an ever-expanding availability of data. Our upcoming course, Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning, provides a thorough introduction to the modern neural network algorithms for the processing of linguistic information.

"I have taken several online courses in AI, and most of them helped me learn something new. But, XCS224N goes right at the top of my list. It is one of the best advanced courses I have taken as it strikes a good balance between theory and practice, beginner and advanced concepts. It makes you work a lot harder than other courses, but the end result is worth it." --Ashish K.

Unsplash Book Club 

‚Ä™One of the biggest challenges of launching a new book is promotion.‚Ä¨

‚Ä™It‚Äôs doubly hard in today‚Äôs environment with no book tours or conferences.

We wanted to do something about this while sharing interesting, new books with you.

So today, we‚Äôre launching Unsplash Book Club ‚Ä™‚Äî a featured collection of books coming soon.‚Ä¨

Each book we partner with, will be giving free-use access to never-before-seen visuals from their book. Sometimes it will be a first look at the cover. Sometimes it will be excerpts or visuals from the book.
See the Unsplash Book Club
	
	
How Innovation Works with Matt Ridley

Our first featured book is How Innovation Works by the incomparable Matt Ridley. Matt is is the award-winning, bestselling author of several books, including The Rational Optimist and The Evolution of Everything. His books have sold more than one million copies in thirty languages worldwide.


What excites us about Matt‚Äôs book is learning more about what underlying conditions lead to innovation. Matt‚Äôs book is full of examples from steam engines to search engines and even life itself. We‚Äôre excited to learn about these examples and think about what we may be able to apply to Unsplash and in life.


How Innovation Works hits North American shelves today and the UK, June 25.‚Ä¨ You can buy or pre-order a copy on Amazon.


If you‚Äôd like to join the Unsplash Book Club, enter your email here. We‚Äôll be launching new books every so often and you‚Äôll get an update as soon as we do.

If the warm weather has whetted your appetite for a summer holiday, this afternoon‚Äôs newsletter contains mixed news. 

On the one hand, travellers bound for a select few destinations may benefit from an intriguing - if vague - ‚Äúair bridge‚Äù arrangement... but everyone else will be stuck in quarantine.

‚ÄòAir bridges‚Äô give Brits hope of holidays abroad
Would-be holidaymakers‚Äô hopes of trips abroad this year have been boosted by proposals to exempt Britons who travel to countries with low coronavirus infection rates from strict new quarantine rules. 

The plan to form so-called ‚Äúair bridges‚Äù between the UK and lower-risk countries was floated by senior Tory MP Huw Merriman and has won the backing of Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. 

The proposal comes a week after Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that it was ‚Äúunlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to be possible for this summer‚Äù, as a result of a ‚Äúblanket‚Äù 14-day quarantine for arrivals to the UK that is due to be introduced from next month.

Why did UK take so long to introduce quarantine?
The UK is set to join the growing number of countries that have introduced quarantine rules for people arriving from abroad - but critics are asking why Boris Johnson‚Äôs government waited so long. 

Brussels-based news site EUobserver reported in March that nine European Union states had closed their borders entirely, and Germany - which has been lauded for its coronavirus response - has had quarantine measures in place since early April.

And the UK isn‚Äôt alone in its weight wars during the global pandemic. According to The Telegraph, Italians emerged from two months of lockdown an average 2kg (4.4lbs) heavier.

The complaint lists numerous incidents of harassment and abuse at McDonald‚Äôs restaurants across the globe, including attempted rape and indecent exposure in the US, a promotion in exchange for sexual acts in Brazil, and a hidden camera in a women‚Äôs changing room in France, reports The Guardian.

WHO says pandemic is ‚Äògetting worse‚Äô
The spread of Covid-19 is accelerating around the world
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The coronavirus news is decidedly mixed this morning, with caution optimism in the UK set against a gloomier picture worldwide.

Testing data show declining infection rates in most parts of the UK, even as lockdown restrictions are lifted, but the global pandemic is yet to reach its peak.

daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1. WHO says coronavirus pandemic is ‚Äògetting worse‚Äô
The spread of Covid-19 is accelerating globally, with infections doubling in the past six weeks, the head of the World Health Organization has warned. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the pandemic has yet to reach its peak. ‚ÄúIn most of the world, the virus is not under control,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is getting worse ‚Ä¶ more than 544,000 lives have been lost. The pandemic is still accelerating.‚Äù

2. Court rules that prosecutors can see Trump tax returns
The US Supreme Court has ruled that Donald Trump‚Äôs financial records can be examined by prosecutors. However, the court said they did not have to be shared with Congress. The ruling has ‚Äúcemented the fact that the public isn't going to get a look at his tax returns before the November election‚Äù, says CNN. His predecessors have made their financial records public voluntarily. 

3. ‚ÄòWork out to help out‚Äô as gyms set to re-open
Gyms, pools, nail bars and tattooists will be allowed to re-open from 25 July as the government lifts restrictions on leisure facilities and beauty services in England. Team sports - starting with cricket ‚Äì will also be permitted to resume. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden urged people to ‚Äúwork out to help out‚Äù. Two reports charting coronavirus cases in England show the number of people with the disease is falling.

4. Government ‚Äòwill borrow half a trillion‚Äô as Covid costs mount
The government is on course to borrow half a trillion pounds over two years as the cost of its response to the coronavirus pandemic mounts. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that this year‚Äôs deficit will reach ¬£350bn - a record for any peacetime year. The Daily Telegraph says the ‚Äúdebt mountain‚Äù will ‚Äúpose a challenge to Rishi Sunak and his successors as chancellor for many decades to come‚Äù.

5. US announces China sanctions over Muslim camps
Washington has announced sanctions against China for its human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. Beijing is accused of mass detentions, religious persecution and forced sterilisation of Uighurs and others. Rights groups say up to a million Muslims have been detained in high-security prison camps across Xinjiang province. However, the authorities deny any mistreatment of Muslims.

6. Boots and John Lewis cut 5,300 jobs as retail wobbles
Dozens of stores will close and more than 5,300 people will lose their jobs as the coronavirus pandemic takes another chunk out of retail. Boots is cutting 4,000 jobs ‚Äì or 7% of its workforce ‚Äì by closing 48 opticians outlets and reducing staff at its head office in Nottingham. John Lewis says it plans to permanently shut eight of its 50 stores, including branches in Birmingham and Watford.

7. BBC suggests staff include gender pronouns in their emails
The BBC is encouraging staff to include their preferred pronouns in email signatures, to make transgender and non-binary colleagues feel more welcome. New guidance, posted on the corporation‚Äôs intranet, says adding pronouns at the foot of emails - for example, he, she or they - is a ‚Äúsmall, proactive step that we can all take to help create a more inclusive workplace‚Äù.

8. Boris Johnson to roll out anti-obesity initiative
The prime minister is poised to launch an anti-obesity drive, starting with a ban on supermarket promotions of unhealthy food. Stores will be prevented from offering buy one, get one free deals on targeted products. However, campaigners are disappointed that Boris Johnoson is likely to delay the introduction of a 9pm watershed on the advertising of unhealthy food.

9. Top charities say lockdown is harming dementia patients
Charities say that families of care home residents with dementia should be treated as key workers. They have written to the government to argue that visits and care from family members are ‚Äúessential‚Äù to residents‚Äô mental and physical health and that lockdown restrictions have had ‚Äúdamaging consequences‚Äù. The letter is signed by the leaders of charities including Dementia UK and the Alzheimer‚Äôs Society. 

10. China warns of virus deadlier than Covid-19 in Kazakhstan
Chinese officials have warned that an ‚Äúunknown pneumonia‚Äù with an alarming mortality rate has broken out in Kazakhstan. ‚ÄúThe death rate of this disease is much higher than the novel coronavirus,‚Äù the Chinese embassy wrote in a warning to Chinese citizens in Kazakhstan. The local health ministry says it has recorded more than 32,000 cases of pneumonia between June 29 and July 5 alone, along with 451 deaths.

Today‚Äôs front pages
‚ÄòYou'd better shape up‚Äô
Reporting on the reopening of gyms, swimming pools and leisure centres, Metro tells readers ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better shape up.‚Äù The Times says that it is time for the nation to ‚Äúwork out to help out‚Äù.

The Mirror prefers to focus on the ‚ÄúJobs hell at high street icons‚Äù after cuts at Boots, Burger King and John Lewis. The Financial Times leads on the same story, reporting that Rishi Sunak is ‚Äúunder fire‚Äù for his ‚Äúpoorly targeted‚Äù support.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve sunk our cruises,‚Äù complains the Daily Mail, splashing the news that the Foreign Office has warned against travel on cruise ships. It says the ‚Äúdramatic intervention‚Äù is a ‚Äúhuge blow‚Äù to the travel industry.

Subject: Spain insists it is safe after UK launches new quarantine

Spain insists it is safe after UK launches new quarantine
Country‚Äôs largest coronavirus outbreaks are under control, say Spanish authorities
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Among those caught out by the UK‚Äôs sudden ‚Äúhandbrake restriction‚Äù on arrivals from Spain was Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who had just begun a holiday in the country at the weekend.  

Like everyone else, Shapps will now be required to self-isolate for 14 days on his return.

The cabinet minister may be feeling confident he will still have his job at the end of it. Others, with less flexible employers, have expressed fears that they may not be so lucky.

daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1. Spain insists it is safe after UK launches new quarantine
Spain says it is safe to visit despite outbreaks of new coronavirus cases. ‚ÄúSpain is safe for Spaniards and for tourists,‚Äù said the foreign minister after the UK abruptly ordered people coming from the country to quarantine. The UK‚Äôs move to require arrivals from Spain to self-isolate for 14 days came into effect on Sunday.

2. Over-40s may pay more tax to tackle social care crisis
People over 40 would start contributing towards the cost of care in later life under plans being considered by ministers to end the crisis in social care. Over-40s would have to pay more in tax or national insurance, or be compelled to insure themselves against ‚Äúhefty bills‚Äù for care when they are older, says The Guardian. Last year, Boris Johnson vowed to ‚Äúfix the crisis in social care once and for all‚Äù.

3. Speaker fears No. 10 briefings will sideline Commons
Parliament could be sidelined by plans for daily televised press briefings from Downing Street, the Commons Speaker has warned. Sir Lindsay Hoyle told the BBC he was worried the proposal was ‚Äúnot the way forward‚Äù and insisted that major announcements should always be made in Parliament first. No. 10 is planning to trial daily televised press briefings from October, modelled on briefings from the White House.

4. Anti-obesity drive to include ban on in-store promotions
Buy-one-get-one-free deals on unhealthy food will be banned as part of the government‚Äôs drive to tackle obesity. There will also be restrictions on where foods high in fat and sugar can be promoted in store and new guidelines for displaying calories on menus. Boris Johnson said the plans would help ‚Äúreduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus‚Äù.

5. Portland demonstrators bring down courthouse fence
Protesters in Portland have brought down a steel fence around a courthouse after days of trying. Federal agents fired teargas and ‚Äúnon-lethal projectiles‚Äù to drive back thousands of demonstrators surrounding the courthouse to demand Donald Trump withdraw the paramilitaries. The Guardian says Portland is the focal point of nationwide protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.

6. Regulator to get tough on airlines over holiday refunds
Regulators are poised to launch a crackdown on airlines that have failed to refund families for flights cancelled due to coronavirus. The Daily Telegraph says the Civil Aviation Authority is understood to have drawn up a list of the ‚Äúworst culprits‚Äù, with millions of customers still owed billions of pounds after being told they could not fly. The body may threaten carriers with a ban from operating in the UK.

7. Republican senator says slavery was ‚Äònecessary evil‚Äô
A Republican senator has called the enslavement of millions of African people ‚Äúthe necessary evil upon which the union was built‚Äù. Tom Cotton, who represents Arkansas, is introducing laws to prohibit use of federal funds to teach the 1619 Project, a project from the New York Times that reframes US history around August 1619 and the arrival of slave ships on American shores for the first time.

8. Health experts call for lift on magic mushroom ingredient
Restrictions on the active ingredient in magic mushrooms are blocking potential treatments for severe depression, addiction and other mental health disorders, scientists and politicians have said. According to clinical trials, psilocybin may be a safe and effective medicine for patients with certain psychiatric illnesses. Experts are urging ministers to order a review of psilocybin and remove the obstacles faced by researchers.

9. Star from Hollywood‚Äôs golden age dies at age of 104
Olivia de Havilland, one of the last remaining stars from Hollywood‚Äôs ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù, has died at the age of 104. During her career, which spanned more than 50 years and almost 50 feature films, she appeared in Gone with the Wind. She was a pivotal figure in getting actors better contracts. At the time of her death she was the oldest living performer to have won an Oscar.

10. Elon Musk challenges Johnny Depp to a cage fight
Elon Musk, boss of the US electric car maker Tesla, has challenged Johnny Depp to a cage fight. In court, the Hollywood actor has alleged that Musk had an affair with actress Amber Heard while they were married. The court heard that the actor had said of Musk: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show him things he‚Äôs never seen before like the other side of his dick when I slice it off.‚Äù

‚ÄòThe pain in Spain‚Äô
Metro talks of ‚ÄúThe pain in Spain‚Äù as new quarantine measure leave up to 1.5m British tourists currently in Spain or due to travel there ‚Äúin limbo‚Äù. The Daily Mirror says new quarantine measures have caused ‚Äúholiday hell‚Äù.

Covering the government‚Äôs anti-obesity drive, the Daily Telegraph tells readers to ‚ÄúLose 5lbs and save the NHS ¬£100m‚Äù. It features a photograph of Boris Johnson walking a dog.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mail says the ‚Äúbombshell‚Äù book about Harry and Meghan is likely to ‚Äúscupper any hopes of renegotiating their royal duties‚Äù in the future.

Subject: Panta rhei | #TheKenChallenge Day 23
From: "The Ken" <info@the-ken.com>
Date: 01-11-2020, 09:06
To: varkey98@gmail.com


Good Morning Varkeychan,
‚ÄòPanta rhei‚Äô said Heraclitus, a Greek philosopher circa 535-475 BCE.

It‚Äôs loosely translated into the oft-quoted ‚Äúchange is the only constant in life.‚Äù

True then. Even truer today.

Before I go any further, let me introduce myself. I‚Äôm Nithin, a fresh face at The Ken and its first dedicated writer for the daily newsletter, Beyond the First Order, shortened to BFO. We write about the changes we see in India ‚Äì in tech, policy, healthcare, business, and money.

If you remember, my colleague Jum had introduced you to our newsletters a few days ago too.

Today, I‚Äôm going to talk about how India is changing, and what it means for all of us. In our lives. In our careers. It affects all of us. Some of us may be employed at a company. Some of us may have struck out on our own. Whether we like it, or not, change is happening, at a pace faster than ever.

Let me show you an example of this change. I‚Äôll illustrate this using a sector I understand and follow quite closely ‚Äî personal finance.

The graph below shows the average lifespan of companies in the US over the years.

Source: Credit Suisse

It‚Äôs a similar story in India when seen through the lens of its stock market index, the NSE Nifty 50. The index saw 50% of its constituent companies churn over the past decade.

Things change.

And India‚Äôs sweeping reforms in 1991 accelerated a lot of these changes.

Suddenly, government run institutions took a back seat. In banking, private banks entered the fray. Today, the once mighty public sector banks are like dinosaurs on the brink of extinction, merging with each other in order to survive. This probably means more job losses, fewer promotions, and more competition for the staff who always felt secure in their jobs.

Shortly after private banks came the non-banking financial companies. They changed the way Indians spent their money. Credit was easy to come by and people‚Äôs aspirations grew. Traditional money lenders were hurt. Even private banks started losing out.

When discount brokerages started popping up in 2011, incumbents were quick to write them off, but today the traditional brokers are a dying breed. Soon, engineering teams which never found their place in a stock brokerage formed the backbone of its operations.

Over the years, distributors of mutual funds have seen their earnings dry up as a sea of regulations engulf them. In the 2000s, it was the abolition of entry charges for mutual fund investments and in the 2010s, it was the introduction of lower cost commission free plans along with a distinct regulation of fee-based investment advice. Fintech companies mushroomed to reach investors at scale. Entire lives and careers have been disrupted.

And mutual funds themselves are today at the risk of being disrupted by fintech companies that put the power of investing in the hands of investors. It is also enabling a host of financial experts to reach a greater audience by offering subscription-based investment portfolios.

Change is here. It‚Äôs faster than ever. It‚Äôs more pronounced than ever. And it‚Äôs more impactful than ever.

The only way out is to stay abreast of this change.

Luckily, that‚Äôs what we do on a full-time basis at The Ken.
Today‚Äôs premium story

Today‚Äôs story, which we‚Äôre unlocking for you, is about one such change but at a country-wide level.

India is hoping to ride on the $13 billion Adani Group, the world‚Äôs largest solar power developer, to take a big leap in solar module and cell production. But, this ambition still has to face China which holds the key to India‚Äôs clean energy future.

You see, China is home to 94% of the global production capacity for silicon wafers. A key component of solar production.

With border disputes on the rise and China losing its pole position slowly as the manufacturer for the world, India might have a foot in the door, but it‚Äôs an uphill climb and it still needs China.

Read this fascinating tale by Seetharaman.

The Chinese eclipse over India, Adani‚Äôs solar manufacturing dreams.

I first heard about The Ken from a colleague at work. Being a consultant, I am constantly researching and learning to advise clients, so the content here was right up my alley!

Ishita Sharma:

‚ÄòHey, did you know?‚Äù discussions about the day‚Äôs story became a sort of a ritual for me and Abhishek at home. When you guys offered the product variation to include a partner, it was a no brainer to share it with yours truly.

Ishita & Abhishek:

One big reason why we are willing to pay for the subscription (aside from the fact that you have awesome research and articulation skills), is that The Ken offers an extremely refreshing and actionable take on a wide range of sectors, that is unbiased and deeply nuanced, even on topics that may well be controversial. This is sadly disappearing from the other mainstream journalism. With The Ken, we find that we can trust the information, make our opinions and have an informed world view, all the while engaged in a conversation with the author.

Subject: Why have an app at all? | #TheKenChallenge Day 25
From: "The Ken" <info@the-ken.com>
Date: 03-11-2020, 09:00
To: varkey98@gmail.com


Good Morning Varkeychan,

It‚Äôs Day 25 of the challenge. Just 5 more days to go.

I‚Äôm Manan and I‚Äôm the Product Manager at The Ken.

Perhaps you‚Äôre wondering what a Product Manager does at a company like The Ken ‚Äî a subscription media publication that has a journalism product. Well, I build products to drive growth and to give our subscribers a great experience. Often, this is neither easy nor straightforward. There are a lot of trade-offs involved. That‚Äôs what Product Managers do ‚Äî they absorb these risks, make decisions and calibrate the results.

Allow me to show you this with an example.

Let‚Äôs say you are a media publication that publishes one story a day to your paid subscribers. You send an email to your subscribers every morning with a link to the story on your website. To read it, the subscriber clicks on the link, is taken to the website and can read the story after logging into their account.

What if I told you that this publication that publishes one story a day, which takes a subscriber an average of 10 minutes to read, decided to build a mobile app just six months after launch?

Why did we do this?

Well, initially, our thinking was that the mobile app was a way to replicate the reading experience of a subscriber from the web to an app.

But over time, quite recently, we found out that we were wrong. So three years later, in March 2020, we took an unusual call. We decided to dump our app and rebuild one from scratch.

Why did we do that? Because two things became really clear to us.

    For a subscription publication to succeed, an app isn‚Äôt just desirable. It is necessary
    All our earlier assumptions for why we needed to have an app were wrong

If you think about it, nearly every traditional media publication has an app. This is for three reasons:

    For traditional news publications, the app drives user acquisition. That‚Äôs why they focus on app rankings, reviews and ratings.
    For traditional news publications, the app is an engagement channel, to send push notifications and to make users spend more time on it.
    Finally, for traditional news publications, the app is a monetisation channel to show ads.

For a subscription-based publication, the reasons are somewhat different.

In fact, subscription-based publications need an app because it solves problems that only subscription-based publications face.

Most apps where subscribers discover content‚ÄîTwitter, Facebook, Gmail, WhatsApp, and others‚Äîhave their own in-app browsers with their own individual session stores. Subscription publications limit the number of simultaneous sessions. Naturally, subscribers end up getting logged out, prompting them to log back in frequently.

Publications go to great lengths to solve this problem. We‚Äôve our own approach, too.

There‚Äôs another reason.

At The Ken, longform articles‚Äîstories‚Äîare our core product. Since last year, when we introduced The Nutgraf, we now have three subscriber newsletters that have quickly become subscriber favourites. And we‚Äôre launching a podcast soon.

But for subscribers of The Ken, the app is where it all comes together. Subscribers find the day‚Äôs longform story and the day‚Äôs newsletters right at the top, seamlessly weaved into the home screen. No reason to go through various apps and websites.

And the way we built it was through feedback from our subscribers.

That‚Äôs more or less what Product Managers do. Not just at The Ken, but in most organisations.

They look closely at existing assumptions, and try to think of new ways to solve old problems.

And sometimes, we manage to put a smile on some faces.
Today‚Äôs premium story

The story that I‚Äôm unlocking today is one that‚Äôs close to my heart‚Ä¶and career.

From door-delivery to dog-walking, startups these days have turned everything into a ‚Äòproduct‚Äô that needs to be sold. But not everyone can sell these products. And not everyone can plan and execute them as well.

With the lines between product and services blurring, there is now a need for a new type of manager‚Äîthe product manager (PM).

Sometimes they do everything. Sometimes, they don‚Äôt have to do anything. Their roles are fluid, changing according to requirements. Which is why you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find a specific job description for these types of jobs.

Project Manager is dead. Long live the Product Manager

But the requirement for them is growing. On Naukri.com‚ÄîIndia‚Äôs number one job search portal‚Äîlistings for ‚Äúproduct managers‚Äù jumped 14% between May 2018 and January 2020. Exactly double the growth of overall job listings on the website.

But even as PMs are being recruited in droves, the role of the project manager, the original PM is slowly growing obsolete. They are from a different era in IT and are not quite equipped to navigate the paradigm shift that products have caused. And now they‚Äôre rebranding themselves as PMs.

Today‚Äôs story explores this significant new trend in Indian tect and the conflict that this new role has brought on. Why does everyone want to be a PM? What is the future of this career path? What are its requirements?

Project Manager is dead. Long live the Product Manager.

From our subscribers

A lot of information and newsletters are available online today. But how do I see beyond the facts at face value and connect the dots? How do I be an informed and critical reader (read: smartest guy in the room)? That‚Äôs when I discovered The Ken.

Other newsletters might be hesitant to write about businesses who advertise with them; you cannot bite the hand that feeds you. The mere fact that The Ken does not accept paid promotions from companies and the Government, is incentive enough for me to read their stories which give an unbiased and nuanced point of view.ost enjoyable for me. The dose of wit is a great bonus.

Subject: Women in news and in the newsroom | #TheKenChallenge Day 28
From: "The Ken" <info@the-ken.com>
Date: 06-11-2020, 09:01
To: varkey98@gmail.com


Good Morning Varkeychan,
Congratulations, you‚Äôve almost made it to the end of The Ken‚Äôs 30-day reading challenge. Just two more days to go.

I thought I‚Äôd get this off my chest by stating it upfront. Today, I‚Äôm unlocking a story for you that touches on an uncomfortable topic: Gender in the tech industry.

I‚Äôm Nadine, one of the writers of The Ken‚Äôs Southeast Asia edition. I‚Äôm based in Jakarta.

I say uncomfortable, because asking questions about gender discrimination in tech‚Äìyes, even in 2020‚Äìcan still trigger heated debates. However, with that learning, today I‚Äôm going to talk a bit about women in the tech industry ‚Äî in companies, in stories, in regulation and yes, in our newsroom. Not all of you may agree with me, but that‚Äôs okay ‚Äî one of the things I‚Äôve learnt after writing deeply reported stories is that reality is complicated, nuanced, and often, more than one thing can be true at the same time.

None of us can claim perfect knowledge. Even my views have changed over time.

Take for instance the infatuation with the idea of meritocracy. Like many startups, for a long-time, even I believed that the most skilled will make it to the top based on their achievements alone and that factors like gender, ethnicity, or connections don‚Äôt play a role. I always believed and trusted that objective methods to support employee‚Äôs advancement and measure their achievements not only exist, but are also faithfully followed by all companies big or small.

Much later, I‚Äôve come to accept that meritocracy is a utopia. Even at companies that mean well and want to do the right thing, the notion that they own and operate a system that‚Äôs free of all bias seems fanciful at best, and delusional at worst.

I‚Äôm not sure if you know this, but over the last few years, the tech industry is coming around to accepting this.

Some understood this easily and readily.

For others, the lessons came at a price.

It took brave women like Susan Fowler (at Uber) and Ellen Pao (at Kleiner Perkins) to draw attention to the persistent problem of gender discrimination in startups and venture capital.

Since then, there‚Äôs been a lot of soul-searching and academic research. And there are strong indications that having a diverse workforce is actually good for business.

Of course, tech certainly isn‚Äôt the only industry with gender imbalances. There are jobs, like auto mechanics, or primary school teachers, where one gender has a vastly higher representation than the other.

Side note: media and journalism are among the most balanced in terms of gender distribution! Here at The Ken, we can attest to that, with a healthy mix of male and female employees across all divisions, including product and engineering, editorial, and across ranks.

Today‚Äôs premium story

The story I‚Äôm unlocking for you today is about this topic.

Here‚Äôs the context.

Companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, and Tesla are setting the agenda for the future. And a breed of eccentric, aggressive leaders like Zuckerberg, Musk, and Bezos helm these seemingly unstoppable companies.

These companies have become so powerful that society is worried about their market dominance.

Curiously, the voices calling for change and reform in the face of big tech are often female.

Like Margrethe Vestager, the EU‚Äôs competition commissioner. Or Lina Khan, an antitrust lawyer. Or Senator Elizabeth Warren. Author Shoshanna Zuboff. Carole Jane Cadwalladr, the journalist who led the reporting on the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

The story I encourage you to read today is by Arundhati, The Ken‚Äôs longest-serving staff writer.

She‚Äôs looking at three women who are taking on Google, Facebook, and Amazon, and what India can learn from them:

Lessons for India from three women taking on Google, Facebook and Amazon.

If the rise of big tech was a story dominated by men, maybe the next chapter will be infused with more female voices.

From our subscribers

I love The Ken for keeping the journalism alive! Most online news portals don‚Äôt verify facts & publish anything ‚Äì and offline publications/ TV are all biased / politically or financially motivated ‚Äì which means doctored news.

Large corporates control how the world perceives them ‚Äì either through paid promotions or other pressures ‚Äì The Ken is one of few portals where one can find well researched articles which shows the true ‚Äì other side of the story.

I haven't seen that many write ups of interview process for more senior engineers, so here's mine. I haven't gone into detail on the particulars of any of the interview questions partly because I don't remember all of them, partly because there wasn't anything super novel being asked and also because it'd be pretty easy for some of these companies to figure out who I am, and there's no need to burn any bridges :D

I did a lot of interviews! These were all done remotely because of covid, which I actually prefered. It makes a big difference to not have to commute. Also is pretty great to be able to interview in sweatpants.

About me:
Experience: 9 YOE at 2 FAANG companies
Education: BS CS at non-US university, not well known
Location for all: San Francisco or Remote
Date: September 2020

My work experience has mostly been in infrastructure, so was applying for roles in that area. Some of the interviews had questions very focused towards that, so want to call this out - I don't expect that everyone would get these types of questions. I was also interviewing for staff level roles, so the balance between system design and coding was different to more starting level interviews. Mention this because no need killing yourself on system design if you're not going for a role that requires it.


I started with some interviews at startups so that I could practice and get over interview jitters. I was also in the process with Google, Lyft and Netflix, but cut them short because I was happy with my offers. I tried to have as many interviews lined up as possible so that I didn't have everything riding on just one of them. As with everything in life, practice really helps.

Because these interviews were all for staff or senior level roles, there was generally a fair bit of back and forth before the onsites, where I had the opportunity to talk to various managers to see if their team was a fit for companies where they hire you into a specific role.

The levels don't necessarily match up with each other based on name. I used this to compare: https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Stripe,Pinterest,Airbnb,Square,Facebook&track=Software%20Engineer


Facebook [Offer]:
Position: E6 Software Engineer
Process:
I was previously at Facebook (but more than a year ago), so I did a shortened loop, but still a full onsite.
Manager Screen: Because this was for E6, did a call with a manager talking through past experience, etc. No coding screen.
Onsite: 2 systems design, 2 coding, 1 behavioral
The double design interview is because I was going for E6.
One question was around a geolocation system and the other around a turnbased gaming setup.
I can't remember the coding questions, but think one round was LC easy+medium, and the second was 2 easy questions.
Behavioural included a very quick coding problem and then was discussing my background and how I work with others.
Other:
The design questions are the most important for this level (according to the recruiter). In these, I tried to show end-to-end understanding and then dig in after the interviewer seemed okay with the overall flow.

Airbnb [Offer]:
Position: L6 Software Engineer
Process:
Manager: Spoke to two different managers about what their teams did, what they were looking for, etc.
No screens - they offered to let me go straight to onsite.
Onsite: 2 systems design, 1 coding, 1 behavioral
The systems design questions were fairly generic - one around caching and cache consistency, the other around distributing files.
Coding questional was practical - log parsing - less LC and more something small that you could actually be expected to do in real life. It was my last interview and I ran out of time.
Behavioral was with the manager and was more like a discussion than a straight interview. No coding.
Other:
I think it's unusual that I only had 1 coding round - not sure why.
I was going for a more SRE role, so the questions did lean more towards that. The team I would join interviewed me so it was a good opportunity to get to see who I would be working with. One guy interviewed me from Starbucks, which sucked because I really struggled to hear him.

Pinterest [Offer]:
Position: L6 Software Engineer
Process:
Manager Calls: Spoke to two different managers within their infrastructure org. Again, around team fit, and role expectations.
Coding Screen: Did 2 LC-ish questions. The second question built on the code from the first.
Onsite: 2 coding, 1 systems design, 1 domain specific, 2 behavioural
Coding questions were LC easy and mediums.
System design question was around designing some limited set of Pinterest features. The interviewer was quite interactive, felt much more like a conversation than a straight interview. I enjoyed it.
Domain specific was around the team I was joining. I don't actually have deep experience in this area, so it was more a loose discussion of how my previous experience could apply, how I've dealt with problems in the technical area before, etc.
1 behavioural was with the team manager, and the other was with their head of infrastructure. Both were more like chats.
Other:
The behavioural interviews seemed half getting to know me and half selling the team to me. I would guess that I had two of them because I was going for staff level.

Square (CashApp) [Offer]:
Position: Level 7 Software Engineer
Process:
Coding Screen: Practical question around parsing data - not LC style.
Leadership Screen: Interview with 1 manager and 1 engineer - behavioural questions around leadership roles I'd held in the past.
Onsite: 1 coding, 2 systems eng pairing, 1 Sys Design/Architecture, 1 Previous Experience (Behavioural), 1 Sell
Coding question was pretty practical - no LC style coding.
Systems eng pairing was around debugging and running some Kubernetes/Docker setup. I had to ssh into an EC2 instance, share my screen and then work through the questions with the interviewer. I didn't have previous Docker/Kubernetes production experience, which they knew, so it was more around seeing thinking processes in debugging, designing systems, etc.
Sys design was fairly standard.
Previous experience really dug into previous projects of mine, what worked, what didn't, with a focus on the people side of things.
And finally, the sell was a chance for me to talk to a senior leader (and have them sell me on the company).
Other:
This was a pretty unusual interview overall. All the interviews had two interviewers in them, one who was shadowing and the other leading it. As I mentioned, I didn't have much experience with the tech used in the systems pairing, but this wasn't an issue as I'd used similar things before and I got the feeling they were interested in my thinking, not whether I remembered specific docker commands, etc. The behavioural was the most indepth one of all the interviews I did - they really got into things and seemed to be looking for very specific attributes. Overall I really enjoyed the interview process (as much as one can enjoy and interview). I hadn't been super sold on Square before, but the interview made me re-evaluate them as an option that I considered seriously.

Stripe [Offer]:
Position: L5 Software Engineer
Process:
System Design Screen: Asked to design an e2e metrics/observability system.
Onsite: 1 coding, 1 technical presentation, 1 manager chat, 1 sys design, 1 leadership/behavioural
Coding question was around string manipulation - LC medium
I was asked to prepare a 20min presentation on a previous project I'd done. We then discussed the work, I answered any questions, etc.
System design was fairly standard.
I spoke to both my potential manager and the head of the org. The org head asked pretty probing questions around previous teams, how I worked with people, handled difficulties, etc.
Other:
Like the Square interview, this was very unusual compared to the normal idea of interviews. It was a lot more around sys design and explaining my thinking than the others. The presentation took a lot of time to prepare (20min is not very long to describe a year long project+all the context to understand it), but it really allowed me to highlight my skills. I don't think it's accidental that this was my best offer - they really allowed me to show them what I was best at.

ByteDance [Offer]:
Position: 3-1 SRE
Process:
2 coding, 1 design, 1 behavioural.
Coding was all LC. 1 easy + 1 medium for each round. For the first of the coding interviews, when I finished early they asked me to describe what happens when you curl a https site.
Sys design was very focused on infosec.
Behavioural went over previous experience.
Other:
They did their onsite over 4 separate hour long interviews spread over a few weeks. All the US ban talk was happening at this time - I didn't get a good idea of what the team or work would be like.

Others:
Did a single coding phonescreen with Lyft (LC medium), take-home exercise for Netflix + coding screen (this one was strange - LC medium, but he wanted it done in a very specific way), was pushed straight through to onsite for Google because I had a short timeline. I dropped out of the interview processes for all these because I had offers I was happy with.


Preparation:
I did every question in Cracking the Coding Interview and went over the answers until I was sure I understood. This provided a really structured way of learning, because the book is broken into different topics. All the the CTCI questions are on LC, but it really helped to have them structured so that it was clear what I was working on while I ramped up. I then supplemented with LC questions. In my opinion, the coding interviews really come down to pattern recognition. You do enough practice so that when you get a question you haven't heard before you can pattern match it to similar questions, and therefore a technique to solve them. I spent about 2 months on coding prep - couple of hours every day.
For system design, there are a lot of wikis and tutorials out there. I found it really helpful to break things down into storage + compute + communication and then see how those were different for various test problems. Another thing I found really important was finding a way to structure my answer so that the interviewer could follow along - especially since I couldn't use a white board. When I started out I would kind of jump all over the problem space. Practiced being more methodical about how I answered the question to make sure I gave a highlevel overview before diving deep into any component. I also went over some distributed system basics like distributed hashing and how different databases do replication, etc. The biggest help here, though, if I'm honest, was my prior experience - not just systems I'd worked on, but also things other people worked on that I heard about, technical blogs I read and so on. You're not expected to come up with this all from scratch - a lot of smart people have designed a lot of smart things, and by having an idea of what is going on outside my specific area, I was able to borrow those ideas in my interviews.
I should also say, that as a newgrad, don't worry about this - you're expected to be bad at this :)
* I jotted down some answers to typical behavioural questions, so that I had given them some thought beforehand and wasn't just spitballing in the moment.

Finally, practicing the process of interviewing really helps! If there's one suggestion you take away from this, let it be this one! It's really scary beng evaluated by strangers, so having some experience of this, before the big day, really helps. In my case I was able to do some screens with companies that I wasn't super interested in, but in the past I've gotten friends to interview me. The LC mock interviews were also helpful.


Takeaways


    So. Much. Talking. On the phone. And over zoom. So many recruiters. Every recruiter wants to talk to you multiple times and this can really add up - I tried to move as much of this as possible to email because otherwise I would spend hours every week just chatting to recruiters. I did my best to just not do phonecalls with sourcers - you're gonna have to speak to a recruiter as well from the same company, who will go over the same information. Some of this I could get out of, some of it I couldn't, based on the company.

    You can't cram learn the system design stuff. If you're planning to interview for a senior position and don't have a lot of exposure in your role to a variety of large scale, distributed systems then read eng blogs, etc. In many ways I got these offers based on this sys design knowledge - not the stuff I had done, but the things that I had seen others do and could then apply to the novel questions I was given.

    Practice. So much practice. I failed some of my earlier interviews because of nerves. But because they weren't companies I was super excited to work for, it didn't matter as much. Nerves are a real thing! They make your brain mush.

    Tap your whole network - and then tap their networks. The only interview I got because a recruiter reached out to me first was with ByteDance - all the others I found someone who knew someone who knew someone who worked at one of the companies. This was a lot easier since I now live in the Bay Area, but I did the same when I got my first job out here (and was still in my home country). I'm not good at promoting myself, and so this required stepping out of my comfort zone and asking people to recommend me. Not everyone said yes, but enough people did. This played a massive role in me not feeling a ton of pressure for each interview - if I failed this one, it was okay, I had a backup.

    Negotiate! Everyone says this, but really. One of the best ways to negotiate is by having competing offers ;)

    I asked about inclusion and diversity at each company - maybe it doesn't matter a ton to you, but I find it very telling to watch a manager talk about this. Even more so for some of the more senior leaders. You get an idea of how they respond to difficult questions (because no tech company is doing a good job on this), and how much responsibility they take for the culture on their team.


And then, for any hiring managers that might read this:
* The best interview experiences I had were at Square and Stripe because they had the interviews that best evaluated my actual abilities. I'm sure it's a lot more effort for them to do it this way, but I really do hope that this is the direction future interviews will go - means you get evaluated over a lot more than just whether you can do a LC medium in 45min.


Edit: As requested, preparation suggestions specific to senior eng:
Given that the defining feature of being senior is experience in a particular area, it's likely that not everything I did will be applicable, so take what works and ignore the rest :) Some of it is also probably pretty obvious, but including in case.
The point I made above about time spent on the phone applies triply here. With staff positions, the recruiter will generally assume you also want to talk to potential managers (or the director of the org you're looking at). It's not just about getting th job, but also about finding a role which matches your background. So, there will be a ton of calls before you even get to the interview stage. The nicest bit about interviewing at this level is that they will be trying to sell the company to you, so really do ask the questions you need to to figure out whether you'll be able to be successful in the role.

People stuff:
Have an answer for what you're looking for in your next role - everyone asks this.
Have a solid leadership story with as much scope as possible. Generally they're hiring you based on what you've done, not your future potential. This bit is super important - be sure of your narrative, and able to clearly define what you did vs others (whether this be code/design/project management/etc). Ideally have it be something where you came up with the idea, did a significant amount of the project management and where multiple teams were involved. It doesn't have to be something that you owned completely, but it does need to be something where you took significant ambiguity and set direction. For example, in my case, I lead the software side of a broader hardware project. I defined the success metrics, feature set, operational changes, deployment work, etc etc. I didn't design the hardware, or decide on the original goal (which is tough at a FAANG company since they're huge), but I took the goal and then figured out was needed from the teams in my area.
* Within this, it's really important to show self reflection and insight - what did you struggle with, what do you wish you had done differently, what was the most challenging part, give an example of conflict and how it was resolved, etc.
* Don't undersell, but equaly, don't oversell. I struggle with self promotion, so it took some practice to start talking about what I did, vs what we, as the team did. The flipside of this is to not overreach. My interviewers, especially the senior management ones, really dug into the specifics. They'll also do a reference check after the fact, so best to not completely make things up :)
* It is impossible to have gotten everything right - be able to talk about your failures, but, make sure you do so with insight so that you can show growth.
* Don't talk badly about your coworkers - there is a diplomatic way to frame even the worst transgressions.
* Because I don't have like 20 years of experience, I don't have a ton of projects that I led at the staff scope, so I would often borrow bits and pieces from other work of mine to answer questions - for example, "provide an example of a time you disagreed about technical direction and how it was resolved" -> this doesn't have to be on a huge project. I was trying to show some range in what I worked on, so would pull answers to things like this from other projects I worked on outside of only the ones I completely led.
Have stories around mentorship and growing other engineers. This can be one on one, or org wide initiatives. Org wide would be things like programs to improve interview quality, tech talks, mentorship programs, diversity work. Things that demonstrate setting "culture".
Be able to quanitify the scale of your work - "this tool was used by 75% of engineers", "This handled 50Tb/s of traffic", etc.
I would say try to demonstrate either technical depth, or breadth. If you have only worked in one area, try find ways to demonstrate how you have exceptional depth in it. If you've worked in a number, use your answers to talk about your work across multiple areas.
Have some prepared questions for them around org setup, culture, etc.
You can really guide a lot of these behavioural interviews - show interviewers your best attributes.
Be friendly!! They have to want to work with you.

Tech stuff:
You've got to nail system design. You're expected to be able to code, but you're adding value at the system design layer.
Be able to show technical depth in your area
Be able to talk about disaster recovery, designing for failure, graceful degredation, etc.
Know how to write clean code, how to design tests (infra: unit, integration, load, performance, etc; product is likely stuff like a/b testing and so on - I'm very clearly not a product engineer :D )
Have examples where you led the meta-initaitives in a broader program to reduce risk. These are all the additional process changes that need to happen to get a big change out. So, with my background in infrastructure, this was all the operational parts of releasing something new (deployment, testing, monitoring, alarming, oncall, provisioning, capacity estimates, division of responsibility, etc). All the technical processes to manage people and risk.
When doing the system design interviews, be able to give the whole system overview before diving in to any specific component. I also got questions here around things like deployment and monitoring (what metrics would you use to check deployment health, how would you pace the deployment, etc), but this may be due to my background.
Might just be infrastructure: Have some idea around what determines the money stuff, and how to calculate expenses. For example, in infrastructure, this is all around capacity costs. Things like back of the envelope numbers, or, how you would go about deriving them ("in order to be able to correctly estimate capacity needs for our rps, I would run load tests on a single host at 80% utilisation" etc etc etc). I hadn't personally had to do this in my previous roles (which is generally the case at big companies), but I could talk about how I would - this shows awareness of the underlying systems and how they map to capex.
For FAANG and many others, its expected that you are still doing technical work as a staff eng - so being able to talk about the parts of the system that you directly worked on is a plus.


Edit 2:
System design resources I used:
I really liked this write up: https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer
It has a ton of resources providing an overview and I then used it to jump off into specific areas I wanted to know more about. I'm sure there are also some really great video tutorials, but I'm not a fan of learning via video, so unfortunately no suggestions there :)

It's really easy to be completely overwhelmed in this area, so honestly, I would start with some sort of guide like the one above and then move through it. Pretty much every concept described in the github page above has had some company opensource their solution, normally with a nicely written blog post that explains the rationale and the chosen solution. Try go for breadth before you go for depth.

Something else to be aware of, is that its okay to be stronger in some areas than others. For example, I can talk endlessly about certain areas, but for example, while I know the HTTP verbs, I couldn't tell you the last time I inspected a POST request, because I haven't worked on a webserver in years - and this shows in my sys design interviews - I quickly skip on to the services side of things. Most interviewers will follow where you lead them (as long as it makes sense).

In terms of specific sources, since I was at Facebook, I kept up with a lot of the internal work there which often ended up on the eng blog. I also kept an eye on big new product releases from AWS, since they almost always match a problem AWS had to solve internally. There is often some description of what problem was being solved, and why.
Looking at what companies do wrt disaster recovery is also pretty interesting - looking at how things could fail tells you a lot about how to design for resiliency. Netflix and its chaos monkeys are a great start. Facebook, Google, etc all have robust DR/chaos engineering programs that they blog about.
Something else I can suggest is figuring out why various things become popular, what problem they solve, and how. For example, why docker? What does kubernetes provide? What would you use kafka for? Memcache? Once you understand a bit about some technology, you start to see all the places where it could be used as a solution.

Finally, if you do decide to follow a company specific blog, I would suggest going with a midsize company rather than something like Google. Google is solving problems only Google has. And its solving so many problems that there are tons and tons of topics covered. Smaller companies are solving problems many companies have, and are likely hitting problems you'd need to know in a systems interview (for example, how to improve your loadbalancing vs, say, laying undersea cables like Google or Facebook).

But again, it's really easy to get overwhelmed. Pick a guide, there are tons, and then stick to it as a start. Hope this helps!

Is the tax burden for the wealthy about to rise further?

With Covid-19 placing ongoing demands on the public purse, the Treasury faces a deficit this year of ¬£322 billion according to the OBR ‚Äì its highest shortfall in peacetime for 300 years.
 
As a result, newspaper and economic commentators all seem to agree on one thing: tax rises appear ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù.
 
If that‚Äòs the case, you could simply let more of your earnings be collected by the taxman. Or you might wish to consider the various tax reliefs HMRC offers for certain types of investments.
 
So, what could you do if you want to reduce the tax you pay?
 
Download your guide to find out

A word of caution: the investments described are not for the fainthearted. They invest in small companies, which are by nature riskier than their larger counterparts.
 
The trade-off is that if you are a high net worth or sophisticated investor you could enjoy very significant benefits ‚Äì whilst also empowering British economic recovery.
 
Tax rules can change and benefits will depend on your circumstances. This concise 20-page guide is not advice nor a personal recommendation ‚Äì it simply explains the main facts you need to know, so you can decide if these opportunities are for you.

Dear Varkeychan,

Today‚Äôs newspaper front pages are the most optimistic we‚Äôve seen since the discovery of the Kent coronavirus variant before Christmas.

While there‚Äôs little doubt that vaccines are changing the rules of the game, it may be a sign of our diminished expectations that the idea of outdoor dining at the end of March is generating quite such enthusiasm.

hope springs eternal
The restrictions lined up to be lifted by May
The lockdown in England will begin to lift within weeks under ‚Äútentative‚Äù plans being drawn up by ministers hoping for a ‚Äúquick return to normal‚Äù in the wake of the vaccines rollout, according to reports.

Government sources have told The Times that outdoor socialising and sports will be the first activities to get the green light from Boris Johnson after children return to school in March. 

Open-air markets and al-fresco dining are also expected to to be allowed to resume at around the same time, ‚Äúbut high-street shops and indoor dining will have to wait‚Äù, says the Daily Mail.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene was elected to her north Georgia district in last November‚Äôs elections despite having previously promoted the pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory and suggesting that the 9/11 attacks and various schools shooting were staged.

‚ÄòToo early‚Äô to book summer holidays
PM warns against planning getaways in the sun
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

With the country back in lockdown, it now seems unthinkable that 2020 saw thousands heading for holidays across the UK.

Those hoping to repeat their trip this year should hold off a little longer, after Boris Johnson said ‚Äúit is just too early for people to be certain about what we‚Äôll be able to do this summer‚Äù.

The PM has promised to shed more light on holidaying after 22 February, when he reveals his long-awaited roadmap out of lockdown.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . ‚ÄòToo early‚Äô to book summer holidays
Boris Johnson has warned Brits that it is ‚Äútoo early‚Äù to book summer holidays - even within the UK. His comments follow a string on contradictory advice from ministers, causing widespread confusion. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps yesterday said that nobody should be planning a summer holiday either in Britain or abroad. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed earlier in the day that he had booked a getaway in Cornwall and was ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù about the summer. Travel company Tui has said it expects to run 80% of its normal capacity for this summer, with 2.8 million customers already booked for its holidays.

2 . ‚ÄòHorror‚Äô videos at Trump trial
Senators presiding over Donald Trump‚Äôs historic second impeachment trial have been shown never before seen footage of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol by his supporters. Police inside the building are seen ushering politicians to safety in the video, sometimes within yards of rioters. The impeachment prosecutors took senators on a ‚Äúwrenching journey‚Äù inside the ‚Äúhorror‚Äù of the insurrection, CNN says. However, Trump is expected to be acquitted as most Republican senators are likely to vote against impeachment.

3 . Kent Covid to ‚Äòsweep the world‚Äô
The Covid mutation first discovered in Kent is likely to become the world‚Äôs dominant strain, according to the head of the UK‚Äôs genetic surveillance programme. Professor Sharon Peacock told the BBC that the new variant has ‚Äúswept the country‚Äù and will ‚Äúsweep the world, in all probability‚Äù. The professor of public health and microbiology at Cambridge University also said her work sequencing new variants of the virus could be required for at least a decade. The Kent variant has so far been detected in more than 50 countries.

4 . Amsterdam overtakes London on trade
Amsterdam leapfrogged London as Europe‚Äôs largest share trading centre last month as the UK‚Äôs departure from the EU led to a shift in dealing of stocks and derivatives. An average ‚Ç¨9.2b (¬£8bn) shares were traded a day on Euronext Amsterdam and the Dutch arms of CBOE Europe and Turquoise in January, more than a fourfold increase on December. Anish Puaar, a market construction analyst at Rosenblatt Securities in London, said that the development is ‚Äúsymbolic‚Äù, adding that London ‚Äúhas a chance to carve out its own niche on trading‚Äù.

5 . PM ‚Äòbetrayal‚Äô over cladding
Campaigners have accused Boris Johnson of betraying homeowners after ministers unveiled a ¬£3.5bn fund to remove flammable cladding that could leave an estimated half a million people still facing financial peril. The Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said that homeowners in blocks less than 18 metres tall would be left out of the fund and will be offered low-interest loans instead. The funding comes four years after the devastating Grenfell Tower fire, which left 72 people dead and more than 200 households homeless.

6 . Green revolution ‚Äòcould cost $13tn‚Äô
A new report has said that oil and gas producing countries face a multi-trillion-dollar hole in their government revenues as the world cuts back on the use of fossil fuels. The report, published by the think tank Carbon Tracker, says some countries could lose at least 40% of total government revenue, adding that its data should serve as a ‚Äúwake-up call‚Äù to oil producing countries and global policymakers.

7 . Flying taxis within five years
United Airlines plans to buy 200 flying electric taxis to ferry passengers to airports within the next five years. The US carrier will also invest in flying taxi firm Archer as part of a $1.1bn (¬£800m) deal to develop the small aircraft. The taxis will be capable of flying a distance of 60 miles at 150 miles an hour. ‚ÄúWith the right technology, we can curb the impact aircraft have on the planet, but we have to identify the next generation of companies who will make this a reality early and find ways to help them get off the ground,‚Äù United Airlines chief executive Scott Kirby said.

8 . Scandal-hit drugs boss given OBE
A pharmaceutical firm boss was handed an OBE in the 2019 new year‚Äôs honours list, despite reports showing that he overcharged the NHS by ¬£80m. Civil servants who were vetting Vijay Patel for the honour failed to notice that he had featured in a front-page expos√© in The Times naming companies accused of overcharging for medicines. Officials then ‚Äúignored the information‚Äù when it emerged during final checks, the paper says. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ‚ÄúRigorous processes are in place to protect the integrity of the honours system.‚Äù

9 . MP threatens court action on leave
A Labour MP is threatening to take the government to court over a bill giving six months‚Äô paid maternity leave to cabinet ministers only. Stella Creasy said the proposed arrangement would effectively award better maternity rights as a reward for political promotion, describing it as being ‚Äúlike a company car‚Äù. Creasy, who is pregnant with her second child, pioneered a system of having a ‚Äúlocum MP‚Äù in place when she had her first child. Her threat comes as the government moves to change the law to allow Attorney General Stella Braverman to take paid leave.

10 . Springsteen arrested on drink driving
Bruce Springsteen was arrested in New Jersey last year and charged with driving while intoxicated and reckless driving, officials have revealed. The singer was also cited for consuming alcohol in a closed area of a national park on the same day, 14 November. Celebrity news site TMZ says the veteran rock star is due to appear in court in the next few weeks. His song ‚ÄúThe Rising‚Äù last year featured prominently in Joe Biden‚Äôs presidential campaign.

Today‚Äôs newspapers
‚ÄòGive us a break‚Äô
‚ÄúGive us a break‚Äù, pleads the Daily Mirror‚Äôs splash this morning after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that it is too soon to start making holiday plans for this summer. ‚ÄúHols on hold‚Äù is Metro‚Äôs take on the story, as it says millions of people have been ‚Äúleft in limbo‚Äù after already booking holiday plans.

The Times leads on a call from Boris Johnson for the final two million unvaccinated people who are over 70 or work in healthcare to come forward for a jab. ‚ÄúNow is the moment to do it,‚Äù he tells them.

And the Financial Times leads on reports that Amsterdam overtook London to become Europe‚Äôs largest share trading centre last month. The paper says there has been a ‚Äúfourfold surge‚Äù in business in the Dutch capital as it mops up trade lost after the UK left the EU.

The end of the tax year is in just five weeks. But there is still time for experienced investors to invest tax‚Äëefficiently and get up to 50% tax relief.

How? This is possible when you invest in young, innovative job‚Äëcreating businesses through VCTs, EIS or SEIS. The government introduced these schemes (with valuable tax reliefs attached) to incentivise investment in these types of business ‚Äì and in recognition of the high risks.

Our free two-page factsheet gives experienced investors an overview of the options: how they work, how they compare, what tax reliefs are available. Download it now ¬ª
Free factsheet: VCT, EIS and SEIS, how do the tax reliefs compare?

IMPORTANT: Tax rules can change and benefits depend on circumstances. The investments mentioned are high risk. To invest, you‚Äôll need to confirm you are a high net worth or sophisticated investor.
Save tax this year or get back tax already paid

You could get up to 30‚Äì50% income tax and capital gains tax relief by backing some of the UK‚Äôs most promising ‚Äì albeit high risk ‚Äì young companies.

What‚Äôs more, you could potentially use the tax relief in the current tax year or even get back tax you‚Äôve already paid for the last ‚Äì but you must act swiftly, before 5 April.

Read a quick summary and comparison of the relevant tax treatment for experienced investors in our free factsheet.

A word of caution: the investments described are not for the fainthearted. They invest in small companies, which are by nature riskier than their larger counterparts. You could lose the amount you invest.
 
The trade-off is that if you are a high net worth individual or sophisticated investor you could enjoy significant benefits.
 
This free factsheet is not advice or a personal recommendation, but it explains the main facts you need to know, so you can decide if these opportunities are for you.

Yours sincerely

George Floyd: the challenges faced by prosecutors in the trial of Derek Chauvin
Failure to secure main conviction could see other accused officers walk free
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin continues this afternoon, a day after jurors heard opening arguments and witness testimony on the killing of George Floyd.

One witness was a 911 dispatcher who said officers pinned Floyd down for so long she thought her security video feed had frozen.

Despite the footage, prosecutors face a number of challenges in what has become a crucial juncture for America‚Äôs race relations.

George Floyd
The challenges for prosecutors in the Derek Chauvin trial
Derek Chauvin‚Äôs use of force against George Floyd was ‚Äúunattractive but necessary‚Äù, lawyers for the former Minnesota police officer have argued at the opening of his murder trial.

Defence lawyer Eric Nelson told the jury yesterday that ‚Äúthe evidence is far greater than nine minutes and 29 seconds‚Äù of video footage showing Floyd‚Äôs death during his arrest last May by police including Chauvin, who denies all of the charges against him.

As demonstrators rallied outside the Minneapolis court, the first prosecution witness later testified that Floyd was ‚Äúslowly fading away‚Äù as Chauvin kneeled on his neck. ‚ÄúHis eyes slowly rolled to the back of his head‚Äù until ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt have no life in him no more‚Äù, the witness said.

Alex Salmond is returning to front-line politics as the chief of newly formed pro-independence party Alba - the Scottish-Gaelic name for Scotland. The former first minister‚Äôs long-running feud with his successor Nicola Sturgeon has threatened to hobble the nationalist cause, but he is now vowing to help build ‚Äúa super-majority for independence‚Äù in the Scottish Parliament.

While Starmer has insisted that his team is ‚Äúabsolutely focused‚Äù on the May elections, insiders have suggested that a shake-up of at least some posts is likely as the party continues to lag behind the Tories. With the latest YouGov Westminster voting intention figures giving the Conservatives a nine-point lead over Labour, here are some of the opposition party‚Äôs potential candidates for demotions or promotions.

Not because of yesterday‚Äôs ‚Äúsoft-soap‚Äù lockdown easing, but ‚Äúthe grand unveiling of Boris Johnson‚Äôs new White House-style press room, built for such a costly sum (¬£2.6 million) the wallpaper may well have been woven from the thread produced by caviar-fed silkworms‚Äù, Deedes writes. ‚ÄúFirst thoughts on the decor? Bright. Very bright‚Äù. Even ‚ÄúLaurence Llewelyn-Bowen might have blushed at the brilliant blue lustre used as background‚Äù. Its oak panelling ‚Äúreminded me of Judge Rinder‚Äôs daytime TV set. Or was it more Premier Inn?‚Äù, he wonders. Either way, ‚Äúthe setting may have been new but otherwise much of what the PM had to say was painfully familiar‚Äù.
