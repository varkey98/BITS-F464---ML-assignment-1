Subject: Excellent performance in JEE Advanced 2021 by the students of FIITJEE CHENNAI Centers
From: FIITJEE <info@fiitjee.com>
Date: 23-10-2021, 19:04
To: varkeychan jacob <varkey98@gmail.com>

From the desk of FIITJEE Chennai Centre Director


Hope this mail finds you in absolute spirits and good health. It has been a complete pleasure to connect with you yet again. I am extremely delighted to share my happiness over the recently declared JEE Advanced results 2021. FIITJEE has proved its legacy in winning par excellence. Our Student Anand Narasimhan from Chennai Centre has brought laurels and accolades by securing the All in Rank 17.

FIITJEE Chennai center has been triumphant in producing Tamil Nadu State Topper for the 14th year consecutively. FIITJEE Chennai center has bagged extraordinary results by securing a total of 15 ranks in Top 500, 28 in Top 1000 ranks and 51 in Top 2000 ranks with overall of 306 selections in JEE Advanced exams. At the National arena, FIITJEE has created a niche by securing a total of 6 in Top 10 ranks, 12 in Top 20 ranks, 18 in Top 30 and 36 in Top 100. FIITJEE student’s stands tall with splendid top ranks and emerge victorious in JEE Advanced 2021 exams, with overall selections of more than 4239 students at PAN India level.

On an average around 14-15 lakhs students appear for JEE Mains every year for the 16232 seats in IITs and only around 2 lakhs students get selected to appear in JEE Advanced. The students work meticulously to secure a rank in top 2000 to get their preferred branch/stream. It is quite obvious that securing a rank beyond 3000 would make it difficult for a student to select a stream of their choice. The above figures of the appearing students speak volumes of the fierce competition prevailing to get admitted in the IITs.

FIITJEE as an institute plays an important role in broadening the mental horizon of young learners and develop right attitude towards learning. It is quite important for us to understand that training students to ace in such competitive exams requires constant updation and to adopt strategies for effective teaching and learning.

“The capacity to learn is a gift; The ability to learn is a skill; but the willingness to learn is a choice”.

In our endeavors to promote serious learning FIITJEE urges every student to learn to utilize every moment of their life purposefully and productively. We believe that learning is a true treasure which will follow its owner everywhere; so cherish this treasure and be lifelong learners. Success is no accident, it is a culmination of hard work, perseverance and most of all love for what you are doing or learning to do. Let us strive to stay positive and derive happiness from whatever we are learning/doing.

FIITJEE makes a strong emphasis that school education is an integral part of student education. We lay focus on quality education and make sincere efforts to ensure that education is not limited to Curriculum alone. Our competitors in KOTA and Andhra Pradesh follow different strategies and part or compromise with the school education. FIITJEE on the other hand has been successful in delivering excellent to extraordinary results without compromising on the school curriculum amidst all potential competitors.

FIITJEE has been striving hard in our constant efforts to uphold our levels of commitment to students in providing an enriching and ethical learning environment. In 2019 one of the topmost coaching Institutes from Hyderabad lured our faculty and poached upon our top students and faculty by promising them with best coaching and took away our students to their institute. FIITJEE with its strong ethical values and principles overcome this challenge with utmost belief that Perseverance, hard work and abiding faiths are indispensable for attainment of excellence. Students who continued with FIITJEE performed better and secured better ranks. FIITJEE has always proved its excellence through one and only thing, its 'RESULTS'.

The toil of years, the sweat of your brow, the struggle you make, everything counts in achieving the goal.

Needless to mention, for securing a top rank in IIT there is no need to part with the school education nor be hooked with any strategy. FIIJEE strongly believes that its best training and teaching methodologies equip the students with all round capabilities in achieving benchmarking success in their academic pursuit.

Take Best Business Pictures With Just Your Phone

Posted: 10 Nov 2021 06:34 AM PST
iPrice
Source: unsplash.com by Jan Böke

Before the rise of smartphones, taking a picture may be a difficult task especially to those with businesses. You'd have to get an expensive camera and editing software for your desktop computer, as well as devote a significant amount of time and effort to learn how to use them. Thanks to our smartphones, we now can capture high-quality images and edit them effortlessly. There are a few additional tools and accessories that substantially enhance your images. Here's how to take and produce stunning pictures like a professional with only your phone for your business. 

Get a good lighting for your shot
First and foremost, good lighting plays the biggest role in producing the best pictures. Due to their small sensors, only a few smartphones can generate outstanding indoor images. Hence, for the best effects, shoot images outside in the ideal lighting circumstances. Lighting affects not only the luminance of a photograph, but also the mood, tone, and atmosphere. 

When shooting outside, choose a time of day when the light is mellow, such as early morning or evening. This creates a soft, even light with pleasing tones. If you must photograph in direct sunlight, attempt to do so in the shade or angling your subject with the sun in your shot.
