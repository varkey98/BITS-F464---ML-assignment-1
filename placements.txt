    Reiterating, the first offer you get is your last offer in the Internship Season 2020-21.

    Ensuring technical support (electricity backup, network) is students' responsibility and the PU doesn't take any accountability for the lack of same at your end. No requests for issues at your end will be entertained.

    Please refrain from any malpractices during the online assessments as it takes a lot of efforts to bring companies, especially in these times and any single act of misconduct could render those efforts of the PU futile.

    All the best for the Internship Season and stay active on your mails and the slack channel for regular updates.

STEP 2: If you have not completed the Online Challenge Registration form (as shown below), you will be prompted to register first before the links to your challenge are made visible to you. Once registered, you will receive a registration confirmation email in your mailbox. 

[Note: In case you encounter an error message “The GOC ID is already registered with a****b@gmail.com. Please use the same email address for registration” while registering, you have previously registered for Google’s Online Challenge with your Cc’d email. Please log out of the Online Challenge website and use the alternate email  (Cc’d) address to register again.]

STEP 3: On the day of the Challenge, you will see a “Start Google Online Challenge” button or “Launch Challenge” link (only once the challenge goes live) on the Challenge homepage.
[Note: If you do not see the button, please check the challenge start time and timezone as indicated in your invitation email]

To: undisclosed-recipients:;

Dear student,

Hope you are doing well and staying safe.

We have observed that a very low number of students are practicing the Aptitude tests (Program-A). Given that placements for semester-1 is right around the corner, and a majority of companies across all domains have aptitude tests as initial screening, we as the Placement Unit strongly advise you to not underestimate the value of these tests. Major filtering of students from the company's end happens in the Aptitude test, making it essential for a student to take it seriously. Historically, we have observed that students who start early and practice regularly have always qualified the initial screening tests easily. The quality of these tests are at par with the actual company tests, also sometimes certain questions are found common between the two. 

We strongly advise you to start preparing by practicing these tests, as onccemente the Placement Season begins, students are found lacking time for preparation. There are company specific coding + aptitude tests included in the subscription, apart from the whole Aptitude preparation module making it beneficial to all the students.

We wish you all the best for the Placement Season ahead.

Please contact us if you face any issues regarding the tests or the platform.

Regards,
Placement Unit.

Hello Varkeychan Jacob Varkeychan Jacob,

Thank you for your interest in Amazon’s Software Development Engineer (SDE) opportunities! We would like to invite you to complete our assessment, which is the first step of our interview process. Please read the instructions and follow the link below.  If you have any questions, please route them through your Training and Placement department as they are the primary point of contact.
 
Online Assessment Overview
The assessment consists of four components, a code debugging section (20 minutes), a coding test (70 minutes), a workstyles assessment (20 minuntes) and a reasoning ability section (35 minutes). At the end of the test, there is a feedback survey that is required to be completed. Browser usage is logged, so please do not access any sites that require login or are private repositories. For the coding sections, manage your time wisely! If you get stuck on a code debug problem, move to the next problem and revisit the questions as needed.  During the reasoning section, you will not be able to skip and return to questions.

The time remaining will be clearly displayed on the screen. You will not be able to stop the timer once you have started each test.  

 
Instructions

    Do not click the assessment link in this email until you are ready to take the assessment in full.
    Though you will not need to download any additional software or applications to complete the assessment, please refrain from utilizing “print screen" as you will be locked out and your session will be terminated. Please also refrain from using copy/paste within the assessment environment.
    We recommend you complete the coding portion solely using the assessment environment provided and ensure it is compiled and submitted successfully.
    Ensure you have a reliable internet connection. We recommend using the latest versions of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox with both pop-ups enabled and ad blockers disabled.

 

System requirements:

    Operating systems: Windows 7, 10 - anything will work as long as the below browsers are supported
    Internet browser: Chrome, Firefox (latest versions), Internet Explorer 9/10/11/Edge and above
    Internet Bandwidth: At least 5 MBPS
    Make sure the following is enabled on your computer: Active Scripting (JavaScript), Session Cookies, CSS, AJAX
    Minimum screen resolution: 1024 x 768

Assessment Link: https://tara.vitapowered.com/workflowengine/workflow/Amazon_SDE_University_Global/start/7a1ddb85-38e8-4fbf-a196-5d2048038903

Next Steps
After completion of the assessment, a processing page will appear verifying your completion.  It may take a few minutes to process. If it does not redirect you after a few minutes, it is okay to close your browser. You will receive an email confirmation once everything has been submitted with next steps. It is mandatory to submit the feedback survey. Your test is incomplete without the submission of the survey.


 
Troubleshooting

Assessment link is redirecting to a login page:

    Double check that pop-up blocker and ad-blocker has been disabled on your browser.  Try Mozilla, if you are using Chrome
    If problems persist, try clearing cookies or loading in Incognito/Private Browsing mode

Processing Page taking a long time to process after test:

    This may take a few minutes to process.  If it does not redirect you after a few minutes please close your browser and you will receive an email confirmation of completion.
    If you do not receive a confirmation email, please inform your college Training and Placement office.

For technical issues that occur during the assessment, please examine closely where you left off.  It is ok to close your browser and reaccess the assessment link.  Your timer will be paused once you disconnect from the session.  Please reaccess the link, accept terms, and scroll down to click the blue "Resume Test" button.  Do not repeatedly refresh the screen. 

For additional troubleshooting steps, go here for FAQs to troubleshoot or use the live chat feature for assistance.

If technical issues cannot be resolved, please notify your college Training and Placement office. The Amazon Student Programs team will work with you Placement office and guide for next steps.

We recognize this is a large time investment and we appreciate your interest in Amazon. If you are no longer interested in participating, or if you have concerns about completing the assessment, please let us know.

We look forward to seeing you through our interview process!

 

Thanks and best of luck!

Before you begin

Before you take the UC Campus Test 2021 - BITS Pilani, we recommend that you take the practice test a few days before the actual test.

Advantages of taking the practice test

    You get familiar with the HackerEarth Recruit platform including the proctoring settings. The actual test may have fewer restrictions than the practice test. This advanced familiarity will enable you to solve problems more efficiently during the actual test.
    An automatic system-compatibility check is performed before you start the test. If your system isn't compatible, you must make the required changes before you take the actual test.

We are pleased to inform you that JSW has tied hands with World Steel Association on their steelChallenge-16 competition. This yearly competition is recognised by the global steel community as the preeminent competition to engage students and industry professionals to showcase their ability to make the best quality steel at lowest cost.  This is a brilliant opportunity to find and nurture talent for the steel industry and needless to say is a great opportunity for the participants to learn and grow.

The World Steel Association opened registration for the 16th edition of steelChallenge. steelChallenge is the biggest steel industry competition where students and industry employees can test their skills using the sophisticated online process simulations delivered by steeluniversity. 

New this year, there will be carbon footprint requirements for the steel grade to reinforce the steel industry commitment to reduce the footprint from its operations.

 

steelChallenge-16 will take place over two rounds. The Regional Championship will take place online on 24 November 2021 from 5.30 PM. Participants will use a combination of the Electric Arc Furnace and the Secondary Steelmaking simulators, producing the required steel at the lowest cost.  They will be asked to produce steel and refine it to the proper chemistry and temperature.

The finalists for the World Championship will include the top student in each of the following regions:

    Americas,
    Asia – East and Oceania,
    Asia – North,
    Asia – West, and
    Europe and Africa.

 

The World Championship will be in April 2022.

All participants successfully completing a simulation run will get an official completion certificate by steeluniversity. In addition, when registering for the competition, participants will get a full pack of learning resources including e-learning courses, 3D interactive models and practice simulations.

The Regional Champions will receive a cash prize, a regional championship certificate and the invitation to the World Championship. They will also gain recognition as the global industry’s promising new generation of metallurgists and will be featured on the steeluniversity website. 

The World Champions will get the steelChallenge trophy and receive an additional cash prize and a certificate.

__

 

JSW will also give out certificates, merchandise and goodies for each student who registered and appeared for the challenge! Hurry Up! 

 

Participation is absolutely free. Participants can register for steelChallenge-16 now at steeluniversity.org. Steps to register are attached below. Through our partnership we have been able to give out free promo codes to interested participants which will exempt them from paying for the challenge. Please also find attached below the promo codes to register and participate. The promo codes are to be filled in during the registration process.
